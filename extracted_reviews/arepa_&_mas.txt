                  Stopped in for a few quick items for lunch with some coworkers, and got the chicken arepa and some wings to share , I loved my chicken arepa, it was so good I got a second one... yes ..a SECOND ONE!  We also had wonderful service! The girls were working when we went in, very friendly and i even learned some spanish!  
                  3.5 stars. The guy who is is always working the counter is super friendly- and remembers returning customers. The wings are always a good mini starter when other friends lag. The chicken arepa is delicious. I am also a sucker for flan-- this place always has 2-3 ones on ice and I can never resist. Between the fried yucca, flan and arepas I am a happy camper when I get the craving.  
                  Five stars for smiles, 3 stars for the chicken empanadas.   They were greasy, oily, and overdone. Flavor was good,  and the choice of two sauces was a nice touch.  
                  The arepa was tasty and delicious, but I don&#39;t think I was worth the 10 dollar price, especially just for a single arepa. The nice ladies working the stand had quick and great service and the beef was juicy and well seasoned. The price is the only thing that will deter me from coming back, especially in a market with so many other options.  
                  This place is located in San Pedro Public Market.  The guy behind the counter let us try the chicken salad with avocado and shredded beef. It was sooo yummy! We ordered two arepas with those meat choices. It comes with this chipotle spicy sauce. You have to try it! It brings out the flavors in the meat. Omg! This was our first time trying this place.   We have made several visits to the Public Market.  I&#39;m so glad we checked it out! We&#39;ll be back!!!  
                  As previously mentioned by others the arepas are good but definitely overpriced, same thing with the empanadas. They don&#39;t use colombian masa for the empanadas so it almost seems more Argentinian style. I&#39;m glad I went to try them but I&#39;m not dying to go back. Juices are pre-made. The cook and cashier seemed a bit overwhelmed, seemed like it was the cashier&#39;s first day. They were friendly though.  
                  Stumbled upon this location because a near by Latin joint was closed.  For me, thank god!  I&#39;m not a real fan of the &#34;other&#34; place.  This place is a Colombian version of tapas.  Arepa sandwiches, empanadas and other small serving of foods.  Wife got their arepa with ham and tomato.  Arepa toasted perfectly.  Ham is real ham, as in &#34;off the bone&#34;.  I got the special treatment.  Their order of empanadas come in 3.  Chicken, beef or cheese.  I wanted to try one of each, but they would don&#39;t it.  They should add that choice.  But they did allow me one chicken with 2 beef.  The chicken got better as I ate.  So good, it disappeared before I gave some to my wife.  The beef empanadas were fantastic.  Nice spice with peas and potatoes.  They serve their empanadas with a habanero sauce.  Good sauce but I really wanted Aji.  Aji would have been 5 stars.  If the food is the same next visit, I will bump to 5.  
                  i cant tell if this is truly different from Arepa Swing that used to be here. I do know however that my carne mechada was solid. The crisp on the corn meal outside was good but it seems to miss the soft pillowy inside that Im used to from my past arepa experiences. This soft inside also is key to soaking up the juices and such from the filling. So part way through the arepa, the paper wrapper just soaked and broke like a pregnant woman with her water. Boo I lost all the good cooking liquid!  
                  Hands down AHmazing! Shredded Chicken, Shredded Beef and the Chicken Patacon....Soooo Good!!  
                  Good food. Came out HOT and quick. Nice ladies. Good portion. Only thought is that the price for one arepa seems a bit steep at $7. But a great meal nonetheless.  
                  Arepas, patacones, empanadas, arroz con leche, some colombians sodas... This place has very good food. The bad thing is that I just wanted some patacones to eat them with a fried rice that i bought but they dont sell them like that, i mean, they would but you will have to charge you the whole value of the patacon even if it doesnt have the sauces on it.  still you have to come here!!!  
                  This place is deliciously great. What a refreshing spot with Colombian food. Plantains, arepas, beans and empanadas. Give it a shot and don&#39;t forget it&#39;s ColOmbian with an O not columbian lol. Try the aji, the apple soda and the flan.  
                  I came to this place today by my friend recommendation. It was so easy to find a parking across the street at Market San Pedro building. I walked only 5 minutes. I found this place to be comfortable plenty of chair and tables (very clean). I found the owner at the counter she gave me a nice welcome to her business. She took time to offer me different plates patiently until I asked my order. I seat and waited only few minutes then I got &#34;Arepa work at de Pollo&#34; it was just delicious, great taste from beginning to end. I also tried empanadas they were so yummy as well. I just want to recognize the team work at Arepas &amp; Mas, plus The kitchen is clean and staff is very friendly. I truly recommend this place to anyone.  
                  Ordered the chicken empanadas on a Tuesday at 2pm. I was the only customer at that time. The cashier lady told me it&#39;ll be done in 7 minutes. I waited patiently at the tables nearby. 7 minutes went by.  Would glance at my watch and then make eye contact awkwardly with the cashier lady over the next minutes hoping she would read my mind as to &#34;I&#39;m hungry and where are the empanadas?!&#34; Definitely took a while for the food to be done. The empanadas were ok...the fried dough is very thick. The filling was tasty and flavorful but was overpowered by the thick fried dough. I do want to come back and try the arepas though. Will also time and see how long the food will take...

Boo I lost all the good cooking liquid!  
                  Hands down AHmazing! Shredded Chicken, Shredded Beef and the Chicken Patacon....Soooo Good!!  
                  Good food. Came out HOT and quick. Nice ladies. Good portion. Only thought is that the price for one arepa seems a bit steep at $7. But a great meal nonetheless.  
                  Arepas, patacones, empanadas, arroz con leche, some colombians sodas... This place has very good food. The bad thing is that I just wanted some patacones to eat them with a fried rice that i bought but they dont sell them like that, i mean, they would but you will have to charge you the whole value of the patacon even if it doesnt have the sauces on it.  still you have to come here!!!  
                  This place is deliciously great. What a refreshing spot with Colombian food. Plantains, arepas, beans and empanadas. Give it a shot and don&#39;t forget it&#39;s ColOmbian with an O not columbian lol. Try the aji, the apple soda and the flan.  
                  I came to this place today by my friend recommendation. It was so easy to find a parking across the street at Market San Pedro building. I walked only 5 minutes. I found this place to be comfortable plenty of chair and tables (very clean). I found the owner at the counter she gave me a nice welcome to her business. She took time to offer me different plates patiently until I asked my order. I seat and waited only few minutes then I got &#34;Arepa work at de Pollo&#34; it was just delicious, great taste from beginning to end. I also tried empanadas they were so yummy as well. I just want to recognize the team work at Arepas &amp; Mas, plus The kitchen is clean and staff is very friendly. I truly recommend this place to anyone.  
                  Ordered the chicken empanadas on a Tuesday at 2pm. I was the only customer at that time. The cashier lady told me it&#39;ll be done in 7 minutes. I waited patiently at the tables nearby. 7 minutes went by.  Would glance at my watch and then make eye contact awkwardly with the cashier lady over the next minutes hoping she would read my mind as to &#34;I&#39;m hungry and where are the empanadas?!&#34; Definitely took a while for the food to be done. The empanadas were ok...the fried dough is very thick. The filling was tasty and flavorful but was overpowered by the thick fried dough. I do want to come back and try the arepas though. Will also time and see how long the food will take...
