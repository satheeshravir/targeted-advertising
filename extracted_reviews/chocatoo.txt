                  Every time I come to San Pedro Market we always come to Chocatoo for their chocolate chip cookie....it is bomb warmed with a cup of milk. It is also so delicious! They are an amazing staff and we encourage them to open up another shop in SF because they would kill it!   Anyhow, this particular night, we tried to get sprinkles at Treatbox and they didn&#39;t have any. So we went to Chocatoo and they specially gave us a small cup of sprinkles! Dreams come true every day at this place! Thank you!!!  
                  Amazing little shop located in the heart of San Pedro Square Market.  The staff is super knowledgable, friendly, attentive, and responsive even during the busiest of times.   As for the treats offered, everything on the menu is fantastic. Cookies, macaroons, and cupcakes are available in traditional flavors, but also in a wide range of unique tastes.  
                  I love coming here after eating at San Pedro Square. Everything tastes great and I can&#39;t get enough of their Reeses peanut butter cup cookies. Until today... I was there around noon and the girl at the counter brought out some day old cookies. She said they were still regular price even though Specialty&#39;s down the street sells their day old pastries half off. I was a little turned off that the day old items were not labeled as such. Not a big deal but they make it seem like they bake their cookies fresh every day.   Aside from that, every thing I have tried there is very flavorful and nice looking.  If I don&#39;t buy a cookie I get the macaroons or the mini tarts. You really can&#39;t go wrong...  
                  ***Cookies and Milk***  So many cookie places and everyone wants to be the rock star. Located in Downtown San Jose, the shop sits at the center of the floor at the San Pedro Market Place. The shop has 3 diaplay walls and a solid back wall which make it a rather large kiosk area. One entire side is dedicated solely to cookies. While the shop offers other desserts including macarons, the cookies looked the most appetizing.  ~S&#39;mores Cookie-4 Stars This cookie has got to weigh a half pound. It is super gooey, decadent, and rich. I rarely say things like this but... this cookie may be a little too rich for me.  At $3.00 a cookie, you do get your money&#39;s worth. This cookie could easily pass as a type of cake and, if heated,  a s&#39; more.  The sweet people that work here and the large sign that offers &#34;cold milk&#34; seal the deal for me.  Real rock stars are those who eat cookiea with milk in bed. This place offers the perfect chance!  
                  As someone with a huge sweet tooth i was sorely dissapointed with this place. I purchased a oreo cheesecake and I only took two bites. It tasted like pasty cream with a lot of crumbs. It did not taste like a cheesecake at all and it was not a cheap dessert. This place is focused on presentation not content.  The iced hazelnut was 90% milk which is not very common and I am not sure why it is made that way.   I wouldnt go back personally, the sweet shop in the pruneyard has quality and thats what this place should strive for.  
                  Their display is gorgeously tempting. It is a visual treat. However when it comes to taste, i felt the flavors were not balanced well. While I absolutely loved the cake in the  red velvet cupcake, the cream cheese icing was so sugary that i could not taste the cream cheese. My friend got a lemon meringue cupcake. The filling was too lemony while the rest of it was missing any hint of lemon. The mini tiramisu and pistachio macaroon were lovely. I would highly recomend the macaroon.  Overall, imho, the flavors did not justify the pricing.  
                  That&#39;s the way the cookie crumbles....  I had read rave-ish reviews about this place on Yelp and just couldn&#39;t help visit after seeing photos of that delectable looking peanut butter cookie with big ole&#39; chunks of Reeses AND peanut butter chips. I&#39;m talking serious business people.  Sadly enough... PB cookie - My cookie did not have large chunks of Reeses, rather a few miniscule pieces. Also, my cookie was overcooked. There is nothing worse than drooling over a chewy, warm fresh baked cookie and having it be overdone. #cookiekiller  Chocolate chip cookie - Okay, it is difficult to dislike a cookie that is warm and oozing three different types of chocolate. The center of this cookie was that delicous doughey taste, and the outsides were a bit crunchy but very pleasing. I feel the warm cookie biased the taste.   They were making fresh cookies in front of our eyes putting dough on the trays. And they will warm up the cookies if you please. Extra sadness for my pb cookie being overcooked.  I would be interested in trying the smores cookie and they had other desserts, as well.  Holy smokes...you&#39;ll be dropping a pretty penny on these at $3 a pop.   These were not even close to the best cookies I&#39;ve ever had. Warm cookie, okay. Best cookie, no way.  
                  Located inside the smaller San Pedro Square building the one with less restaurants. The one that has Blush lounge and restaurant.   I like their setup it&#39;s easy to see everything on display and everything sure does look good. Grade A for presentation.   Taste wise? I&#39;ve had a chocolate chunk cookie warmed up and thought it was ok/good. Not bad. I&#39;ve had a mousse type dessert that was just ok. Most recently I had their Oreo cheesecake that tasted good for the first couple bites then tasted bland. Maybe it needed to be at a colder temperature so I put it in the fridge at home. I&#39;ll update this if it tastes better colder...yes it tastes better colder. I could see condensation on some of the desserts in the display so I don&#39;t know if their fridge temp wasn&#39;t as cold or was increasing.   Checkout line moved fast. The girl asked how many forks I needed so that was nice. Overall A-Ok for three stars.  
                  This is a great place to get delicious desserts! The staff is super friendly and will answer any questions you have on the desserts! Fresh and also great to look at but a lot better when you eat it !  
                  Cooooookkieeeee Coooookieee  So fatty but so good!!! I got a chocolate chip cookie and devoured it.  
                  The cookies are what caught my eye. This counter sits right smack dab in the middle of the Public Market. You definitely cannot miss the smell or the huge cookies staring back at you.   I opted to order the Triple Chocolate Chip and Reese Peanut Butter Cookies. I also grabbed a coffee macaroon as well. They warm up the cookies for you and the chocolate starts to melt in the bag. Smelled so good!!!  The sweets are addicting. My fave was the Reeses cookie. OMG!!! Definitely a must if you stop by. The mixture of chocolate and peanut butter together is heaven.   Fast and quick service on a busy Saturday afternoon.  
                  Tried the chocolate chip, peanut butter cookie, and the smorcon. It was just okay, nothing to write home about. All the items were too sweet for me.   Service wise it was also a miss. The girl who helped me out seemed really bothered. Like girl, I get that it&#39;s an hour before closing time  but can you at least try to be more professional. She was talking to this guy who probably works around the market too before helping me out, so it seemed that I interrupted her shot at love. Oooops! I&#39;m such a c*ck block! My bad.  
                  Excellent place to fulfill your sweet tooth cravings!  What can I say, I&#39;m a sucker for sweets...especially chocolate. I was here a couple of days ago to surprise my friend with some cookies for her birthday. I originally went in thinking I would get the cookies and be in and out of there in only a couple minutes. Well, I ended up staying a bit longer because I couldn&#39;t decide what I wanted for myself lol.   Chocolate chip? No, not chocolatey enough. Double chocolate chip? Nope. Triple Chocolate chip cookie? Bingo. I ended up ordering a couple triple chocolate chip cookies for myself, and about half dozen peanut butter cookies for my friend. Safe to say we both thoroughly enjoyed them! Perfectly chewy, no doughy taste, and if you warm them up the melted chocolate is just... well amazing.  Nothing much to say about the service here. It was fast and friendly. You know I&#39;ll be back in here again.  
                  Every time I walk by here, I want to stuff my face and explode.  The service is wonderful. We had nowhere to sit to eat our Konjoe burgers, so I did what a scumbag customer would do and asked if I bought a little pistachio macaroon, could we sit here? They had no problems with that so we ate our burgers happily while the macaroon sat nicely on the surface.   Ten minutes later, I ate it. It was great.  
                  Absolutely love this place! I have been a few times to satisfy those mid-day dessert cravings, and Chocatoo never fails to impress. They are always nice enough to warm the cookies before serving (I rarely see any bakery doing that voluntarily), just as warm as you&#39;d like them :-) My favourite is the Reese&#39;s Peanut Butter Cup ... Pure GENIUS. I do suggest coming here and getting a taste of the lovely desserts as well (lava cake is my fav). The service is fast and their hospitality is always genuine. When I was there, they suggested I try their coffee too. The vanilla latte was amazing and hit the spot. My 5-star rating should probably speak for itself, but I love to ramble, especially when things are this good :-)  
                  This is solely on them Peanut Butter Cookies that are chillin on the side luring folks like myself.  I havn&#39;t tried anything else here, but the cookies. They do have a variety of other desserts, which all look great. Perhaps maybe one day I can see if the taste match the looks.  BUT, the cookies are legit. I tried the Smores cookie, but it is way too &#34;chocolaty&#34; for me. Not to say it&#39;s bad. It had just the right amount of being soft and chewy with the edges being a bit more harder to give the perfect balance of textures. I&#39;m just not that into so much chocolate. If you are really into chocolate though, that is the cookie for you.  What I&#39;m rating my high rating on is the Peanut Butter cookie. Just like I described on the texture above, but the flavors were legit. Probably the best peanut butter cookie I&#39;ve had. It was more of a chocolate peanut butter cookie, because there are chunks of Reese&#39;s Peanut butter cups on top. BUT, the chocolate steps aside and only complements the main attraction of the cookie---which is the peanut butter. So if you enjoy peanut butter, and enjoy cookies, try one!  **YELP PRO TIP** ask them to warm it up. That is the only/best way to enjoy it.   This is inside the San Pedro Market Square. So great vibe and atmosphere. I swear reviewers who rate a place lower due to parking makes me SMH  
                  Cookies are AMAZING. Coffee is way better than starbucks cause they actually care about your drink. The desserts are beautiful and yummy. The handmade chocolates + fudge + smorcon (caramelized bacon smore) top it all off.  They even have delicious gluten free items like macarons, lava cakes and flour less chocolaye cake and more!   The ladies are super friendly and the owners are beautiful and have smiles that make the shop so welcoming and wanting to be at chocatoo all the time!   OH! AND you have to order at the display case just so that lines don&#39;t get confusing for the ladies. There is a line at the display case to order cookies, drinks, and desserts. And then you get sent to the register to pay.  
                  I love this place! The cookies are so good...it&#39;s bad. Especially when you ask to have them warmed up! I love the chocolate chip one as well as the s&#39;mores. It&#39;s especially dangerous when you&#39;re hanging out near San Pedro square and have already had a few drinks.....and need something to fulfill your sweet tooth.   I will definitely be back.  
                  Nice variety of sweets, especially liked the macarons and the lemon tart. Coffee was good and I like the fact that the lid is pink (I am a girly girl). I went on a Friday night and it was super packed, and I thought I would be the only one having coffee in the middle of a myriad of people having their beers and wines, but no. I had to be in line for a while until I got my caffeine and sweets dose. Service was ok, but too in a rush, which I guess is normal considering the amount of people and only 2 ladies working that shift. Very pleasant to the eyes, cookies and pastries look as good as they taste, but found it a little too pricey.  
                  I REALLY liked this place for 2 reasons.... the staff and they have a couple of gluten free options that taste amazing. I LOVED the molten chocolate gluten free cake! It was so good! My daughter had the chocolate dipped marshmallow and that was a hit. I definitely want to go back and try a few other options and give their coffee a try. Will update:)  
                  My hubs had a client meeting in San Jose and callrd me if I wanted some desserts. I told him to check my Yelp bookmarks and I&#39;m sure I bookmarked something. So he went to this place and bought me all the cookies lol. The large cookies are $3 each and they have a small macadamia cookies for $1.90.  PEANUT BUTTER ($3): The best peanut butter cookies I have ever eaten! My hubs and I was fighting over it lol. It was so soft and chewy. There was peanut butter inside. It was so good!  TRIPLE CHOCOLATE ($3): Soft and chewy as well.   S&#39;MORES ($3): Taste like s&#39;mores. It was soft, gooey, and chewy. I like the melted marshmallows &#39;cause the cookie gave it more chewiness. The graham crackers crumbs were perfect for a little crunch.  M&amp;Ms ($3): I don&#39;t really care much for M&amp;Ms cookies, but it&#39;s still good and chewy.  MACADAMIA ($1.90): Definitely a No-no!! I don&#39;t know if they served an old batch of these cookies, but these were nasty and stale.  I think the price of $3 per cookie is worth it since they put so much toppings in it. Definitely gonna come back for more peanut butter cookies!!  
                  The chocolate chip coolies are slightly misnamed - they really are more like chocolate CHUNK cookies. It&#39;s amazing these cookies have any integrity at all, given the amount of chocolate contained within each cookie. 40% gooey delicious chocolate, 60% soft, crumbly cookie.  The service is excellent. The staff take your orders while you&#39;re in line for the register, making it a very efficient process. Always one of my favorite stops in San Pedro square.  Sorry, I devoured the cookies before I thought to take a picture. Maybe next time I will have the necessary patience.  
                  My friend, Vee L., mentioned this dessert spot on a spontaneous trip to SPM and I knew I had to try it!   We decided to share a Triple Chocolate Chip Cookie before a GNO bar hopping. We were lucky and got the cookie minutes after it came out of the oven. The cookie contains three types of chocolate chips like the name states and it was melty and gooey with chocolate in the middle with a crisp edge. The perfect cookie, IMHO.  The workers here are lovely and watching them make desserts is interesting as well. For a cookie that&#39;s almost $3, it&#39;s totally worth it and definitely enough to share between two or for one to indulge oneself into bliss ...  They accept card and cash.  
                  This chocolatier is the perfect place around work downtown to get my sweet tooth pampered and my chocolate cravings sated. They have a large variety of sweets and pastries, including small cakes and mousses, cookies, truffles, and chocolate bars.  My go-to here is the chocolate macaron. While it is not the best I&#39;ve had, the flavor is pretty darn good. The texture of the macarons can vary depending on how far in advance the macarons sit in the counter versus the fridge. I&#39;m never actually satisfied with the texture, but the macaron is enough to quell my dessert-tooth after lunch. Also, not too badly priced, at $1.60.  I also have tried a $3 truffle. Not really my taste. It is not as fudgey as I&#39;d like, with the coconut/palm oil delivering too much flavor that I think undermines the chocolate flavor a bit.  I&#39;ve always gotten good service from the people here, but given the prices and quality of product, I would give this place 3 stars.  
                  Man, I am craving one of these giant cookies just thinking of Chocatoo!  One day the bf &amp; I were en route to San Pedro Market Bar but cut through this building &amp; immediately upon entrance, the smell of freshly baked cookies hit us like a ton of bricks! We walked around following our noses &amp; it lead us to multiple racks of fresh, out-of-the-oven, cookies!   Although the triple chocolate chip was very tempting, we opted for a Reese&#39;s peanut butter cup cookie. $2.50 a cookie is kinda steep but it was a good size. It was soft, chewy &amp; oozing with warm chocolate. Is your mouth watering yet? ;)  So glad we decided to indulge our sweet tooth before heading to dinner because we might&#39;ve been too full for it after! If you&#39;re craving something sweet, I would definitely recommend stopping by Chocatoo to fulfill your needs!  
                  Everytime I&#39;m in the mood to eat chocolate chip, nothing beats Chocatoo&#39;s super dooper fudgy crisp on the outside chewy on the inside JuMBO CHOLATE CHIP COOKIES! Oh myyy goodness! Id prefer it not to heat up because it gets too messy to eat if its heated. Everytime i took a bite on it its major FOODGASM! Excellent job!  
                  Best cookies ever!  I am a cookie fanatic always in search of the perfect cookie and I found it at Chocatoo.  Their peanut butter cup cookie is my favorite, which is extremely peanut buttery.  I would only recommend it for die hard peanut butter fans, like myself.  My boyfriend loves the smores cookie, which is a fan favorite for those who like chocolate.  The cookies are a little pricey at $3, but they are worth it, plus they are so rich I could never eat more than one.  My raving ends at their cookies.  I have had a couple of their other desserts, but nothing has made an impression on me.  So if you visit, just stick to the warm cookies and cold milk.  
                  Really fucking good.   Like, this place has the kind of cookies that melt in your mouth. They belong in heaven. They&#39;re to die for.   Okay, I wouldn&#39;t actually die for them. But, I wouldn&#39;t complain if these cookies were the last things I ate before I died.   I got a triple chocolate cookie. I love chocolate. The best kind of cookies are the ones that are a little crunchy on the rims and super soft on the inside. So soft that they crumble when they&#39;re warmed up. $2.90 is definitely worth it.  
                  The best desserts in town!!!! They have assortments of different desserts, and even some gluten free ones!! I recently hosted a tea brunch at my home, and called into Chocatoo a few days before to place a catering order. They were very thorough, and had it all ready for me on the day of.  I have to mention the make the best Mexican Hot Chocolate i have ever had the pleasure of sipping made beautifully by Sandy.  The owners are always friendly and willing to help out, suggest, and make your dessert eating experience impeccable.  
                  Ok seriously.   Their chocolate peanut butter cup cookie is the freggin BOMB. It makes me want a whole tall glass of milk on the side !! For $2.50 per cookie there&#39;s gotta be crack in it.   My friend introduced me to this place. First she raved about the CCC. So good. Then about the s&#39;mores. Also so good. They warm them right then and there for you if they aren&#39;t fresh.  One time I got a s&#39;mores cookie and it was stale AF. I thought I was gonna chip my tooth !! I had already attempted to scarf down 1/3 of it and my friend insisted to ask them for a new one. After some hesitation, I asked them if I could have a softer one. They offered me a whole new cookie but being a little brat I asked for a peanut butter cup cookie instead haha. They were more than happy to give me what I wanted. Thank you!  Happy camper.  
                  I stopped by and grabbed a S&#39;mores cookie:  yelp.com/biz_photos/choc…   Pretty good s&#39;mores flavor combination, but a little too sweet for me.  
                  The three star sucks, I&#39;ll tell you why. 1. Location...Seriously, in a downtown food court?! ONLY in cow town San Jose. 2.Price.  3. quality/flavor.  Elaboration. You ready?  1. This has got to be the DUMBEST place to open a business, I&#39;m sorry but it is. Why would a city put its resources into opening a downtown FOOD COURT!!!!! Who does that?! And who opens up a chocolate store in the middle of said food court!?!? Might as well open up shop in valley fair....If you opened this places around the downtown area, trust me, everything else will flourish..Wake the F--- up San Jose.  2. Price, not horrible, but for what you get, it kind of is..2.50 for truffles? no bigger than a quarter? Which brings me to my next point.  3. Quality...Your guys&#39; salted caramel is WAYYYYYYYY too salted. The saltiness of the caramel over powered the taste of the caramel and the chocolate, nothing was complimenting anything!..The espresso truffle was decent, but too much espresso to chocolate flavor. Again, nothing complimenting anything.  Now you must be saying &#34;Oh, I assume this arrogant prik is some chocolate expert&#34;. No I&#39;m not, however, in my 4 years of fashion industry experience, it allowed me to travel to countries most can&#39;t go to. Belgium, Holland, Germany...You get the idea, I&#39;ve spent 70-200$ on a piece of chocolate, and I know what proper chocolate taste like.  For the 2.50 per truffle, you can go to a place in NYC or S.F or LA that will run circles around this stuff...I&#39;ve been to them.(there is even a few in SJ)  Now, you&#39;re saying, &#34;all this negativity, how did it manage 3 stars?&#34;. 1.The brownie was pretty good. 2.The lady who worked there was very nice. 3.It really isn&#39;t THAT bad. Just a few tweaks and the stuff would be 4 star material.   I&#39;ve just realized most people who review chocolate places and say &#34;OMG SOOOOoOoOoO good!&#34; Really haven&#39;t had good chocolate. Most of them are also women, if you realize, and women really don&#39;t mind what kind of chocolate it is, as long as it&#39;s chocolate..Don&#39;t lie, you KNOW it&#39;s true.(yeah, yeah, that sounded sexist, but it&#39;s a fact)  Will I be back? Maybe.  
                  My husband is obsessed with the Smores cookie. I&#39;m pretty sure the girls that work there know him by name. Everything we have both ever tried is awesome. The pecan bar is super delicious.   I love that she has gluten free options. The gluten free chocolate cake is so decadent.  We love this place!  
                  I really cannot understand all the positive reviews on this place. Granted, I&#39;ve only had a couple of their desserts, but the chocolate chip cookies were nothing to write home about. I&#39;ll take Bijan any day.  
                  The peanut butter cup cookie is ridiculous. Soft, moist, decadent -- insanely good. And probably terrible for my wedding diet -- the cashier put my cookie in a brown bag for me, and by the time I got to my office the bag was nearly transparent from all the oil oozing out from the cookie. Mmm, delicious!  Price seems a little steep though. One cookie is nearly $3 (you could get six apple pies from McDonald&#39;s for that money!).  But I&#39;d come back again the next time i need a mid-afternoon sugar fix.  
                  I tried the chocolate mousse which had white chocolate, semi sweet chocolate mousse and a crust at the bottom that tasted like Oreos. The dessert overall was more solid than I prefer mousse to be and was tasty but too sweet. It was definitely pretty as were all of their other desserts (mango mousse cake, cookies, macarons, marshmallow pops, etc).  
                  They had warm cookies, bite size tarts and macaroons. The caramel and pistachio were perfectly chewy and very good. The chocolate and raspberry tasted stale and artificial. Not a bad sweets venue though.  
                  I first discovered this place when I passed the shop window in San Pedro and saw all of the delicious looking desserts; I had to step in and try some. The peanut butter cookies are really what sold me in the end, probably one of the best cookies I&#39;ve had in a while. I also tried the basic chocolate chip and chocolate cookies, both were pretty good, but I didn&#39;t think they were as good as the peanut butter ones. They also sell all sorts of different cakes, coffees, chocolates, and a lot more different desserts. Good service and delicious cookies is all I can ask for.  
                  They have a delicious crisp chocolate chip cookie that&#39;s gets my attention when I go to San Pedro Square.   The owner is a very cute Australian transplant. Very hardworking and personable.  
                  I&#39;m a sucker for sweets.  Cookies are the worst for me and walking by this spot I couldn&#39;t help but notice the big chunks of chocolate chips, the peanut butter cups, all laying out on the cooling racks waiting for me to notice.  It didn&#39;t take much for me to saunter over here where my radar goes off automatically whenever I sense any kind of desserts.    I told myself that I would fight the urge and say no.  And I did....  We had dinner first and of course, there was one image that I couldn&#39;t erase from my mind.  They were the hot cookies on the cooling rack.  I was picturing myself taking a bite of a chewy cookie and how good it would taste in my mouth as I gulped it down with a glass of milk.    Before I knew it, we were walking straight back to this place and there I found myself in front of the cooling racks, staring at the cookies that had my name on it.  Wait you didn&#39;t see Lorie&#39;s name?  I did. (Flashing lights and all.)  I restrained myself and ordered one Peanut Butter cookie and a Banana Coconut Fudge.  The cookie was warm, chewy with the peanut butter melting in my mouth-- exactly how I imagined it to taste.  The Banana coconut fudge however was a big disappointment.  I took one bite and it was sweetness overload.  I felt like I was eating a huge chunk of mushed up sugar with artificial banana flavoring.  I promptly put it back in the bag and handed it over to my friend.  
                  Well, this review is for the freshly baked cookies.  I&#39;ve had the triple chocolate chip and the smores cookies.  If they are just out of the oven, they are great.  If they are cold, they are great.  If they microwave them, um, make sure to get lots of paper towels because the amount of butter in them is astronomically insane and that&#39;s fantastic.   If you see the parchment paper after they remove the cookies you can see they are completely soaked in the excess butter than runs out of the cookies. (well, maybe they spray with them with pam...). I love their cookies and would eat them daily if I had a way to survive the sugar and fat shock...  
                  I was most excited about the S&#39;morescon.  It was very disappointing and not worth the price and excitement.  The little strips of bacon on top was not enough.  The item was just a gigantic marshmallow.  I wish I would&#39;ve just gotten all cookies.  Get the cookies!!!!!!!  I would&#39;ve given them 5 stars if I would&#39;ve just gotten all cookies.    The young lady working that day was very nice and thoughtful.  We were just visiting and she packaged my desserts perfectly.  Much appreciated!  
                  Update: After trying their chocolate chip cookie I am tempted to add a star as it was that good. It&#39;s a large, delicious, soft on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside cookie with big chunks of chocolate and it&#39;s a whopping 3$ each. The cashier however was not very friendly. And if you are familiar with San Pedro square you will know it gets loud and quite crowded on weekends.   Very cute dessert spot and they open late. I had the &#34;death by chocolate&#34; and it tasted ok but nothing special (like a cold chocolate cake). Apprently they are famous for their cookies, next time I will try it.  
                  Disappointing, not worth the calories. I made a better peanut butter brownie at home and the lemon tart was so-so.  
                  I took a look at Chocatoo &amp; asked a few questions.  They are not made on site, they have a kitchen in Sunnyvale &amp; then bring it in.    Lots of desserts that looked really good, but you can&#39;t really tell how good they are if you don&#39;t have samples, no samples!  Cupcakes $3 - I&#39;m never happy with cupcakes so just looked. Macarons $1.25 - I wanted to try, but too full Cake sliced in a square $6 - I think it&#39;s too high! Big cookies $2.5 - seemed high pricewise.  Looked good though with chocolate chunks &amp; stuff in it.  I asked if they do half off at the end of the day, No she said.  Boo!  
                  There is no way I am able to pass this place without getting a tasty treat.  Their display always catches my attention and before I know it, I&#39;m happily munching on said treat.  Today it was the chocolate eclair.  As eclairs go, this one was one of the better ones I&#39;ve had.  The creamy vanilla filling was pure heaven.  The shell was just the right texture with enough chocolate to satisfy that cocoa craving without overpowering the creamy filling.  My boss got the red velvet cheese cake which was freaking divine. It was super rich and was best shared with others.  I&#39;ve also had their macaroons (pistachio) and their triple mouse dessert.    My only qualm with Chocatoo is their prices.  I paid $5 for the eclair and $6 for the red velvet cheesecake.  Their tiny cupcakes are $2.25 each! I could probably eat them in two bites.  For as good as their desserts are, I think they&#39;re a tad overpriced.  
                  Freshly baked, gigantic chocolate chip cookies here.  Get a scoop of ice cream from next door and dip your gooey cookie in it.  Or vice versa!  Glob the ice cream on the cookie like a schmear of peanut butter!  The cookies are best when they&#39;re fresh out of the oven so if you see them cooling out on the racks, stop by!  The cupcakes are so so.  Go for the cookies!  
                  GET THE SMORES COOKIE!! And get me one while you&#39;re at it.  you can thank me later.  
                  Oh my word, what do they put into these cookies?!?! I was instantly attracted to this dessert stand while I was having a beer a few feet right at the point they removed fresh cookies from the oven. The aroma of sugar and chocolate filled the air, and I could resist no longer.   When I got my cookie, it was still warm and gooey. I took a bite, and it just melted in my mouth. I wanted to eat cookies here all night afterwards. Instant addiction.   You can step it up a notch and get a stout at market beer company to pair with the cookie. Heaven.  
                  Irresistible-looking cookies and desserts being made fresh for all to see, in a highly visible station right in the middle of foot traffic at San Pedro Square Market. The cookies are perfectly fine, particularly the peanut butter cup-chocolate chunk cookies, if a bit spendy, while other offerings like macarons are simply decent and affordably priced. Edited to add: I&#39;ve also tried cupcakes, mini-mousses, and other pastries, and they&#39;re also all perfectly decent, in a 3-star way.  A decent, satisfying experience overall, although if you want something truly gourmet and mindblowing, check out some higher-end patisseries on your next visit to the city - SF, that is.  
                  Love Love Love this place!!!  Their fresh-out-of-oven cookies are to die for (and trust me, I&#39;m a cookie snob).  You can smell them from far away.  I also love their macarons!  
                  I stumbled upon this newly built Market area (think smaller Ferry Building or Oxbow Market) while walking around downtown SJ.  It&#39;s soo cute!  My sweet tooth took over and spotted Chocatoo.    It was so hard to decide what to get but we got the Triple Chocolate Mousse Cake ($6).  It was just as delicious and decadent as it sounded.  Plenty of dark, milk and white chocolate.  It was moist enough as well.  He also wanted to sample the chocolate covered pretzel ($2ish) so we got that as well.  It was an interesting salty sweet combo, but more on the salty side of course.  The chocolate covered only about 1/3 to 1/2 of the pretzel however.  Chocatoo has plenty of eye catching and tempting desserts for any of those craving some sweets.  They are on the pricey side though.  All in all, I think it&#39;s worth a try if you&#39;re in the area.  3.5 stars.  
                  Chocatoo is proof that looks can be deceiving. Their desserts look very pretty but I wasn&#39;t impressed with the ones we tried. I appreciate the customer service which is overall good and personable.  The raspberry mousse looked like a big giant macaroon with a creamy center, but overall there was a weird aftertaste. The Chocolate hazelnut mousse fared a bit better. It was a dense dessert that coats the back of your spoon and not too sweet. I couldn&#39;t make out the hazelnut flavor though. But I kept eating it anyway because it was right there in front of me  #totalfatty  Definitely skip the cupcakes because the cakes are on the dry side. Prices are a bit expensive for what its worth: $6 for the cakes and $3 cupcakes.  * please refer to Denise L&#39;s review for more details *  
                  Don&#39;t listen to others, the Reese&#39;s Peanut Butter Cup cookie is wayyyy better than the Chocolate chip! However, I may be bias since I do love my peanut butter... I&#39;m always so tempted to get one whenever I pass by this place, which is probably every weekend. No bueno for my waistline. :(  It is $2.50 per cookie which is a little pricy, but worth it. I haven&#39;t tried out their other items yet...but I will one day if I&#39;m not lured away by that damn cookie.  
                  Great location! Conveniently located in San Pedro Square Market for a quick dessert after a meal at one of the other places.  The cookies looked good, but I didn&#39;t actually try one...  Instead, I had the macarons.  The only had 3 flavors when I was there, none of them being flavors I prefer, so that was unfortunate.  At $1.25 per, they are priced well for the area.  They had a very good texture.  Chewy &amp; moist (maybe too moist even?)  No crumbling going on here.  The flavors on the other hand were sub-par.  The chocolate wasn&#39;t that chocolatey, and the mixed berry tasted like a fruit jam I would buy at a grocery store.  _____________  Conclusion: Not a place I would seek out, but it is just such a convenient place to get a dessert after a meal in San Pedro Square Market.  
                  A few hours w/o the monster, I figured I should take FULL advantage of that by going to a place to not only knock off a bookmark, enjoy a good meal, and to relax w/o the need to constantly watch over someone.  This past Sunday, I had a chance to do just that!  After venturing Japantown, I stopped by Jimbo&#39;s but nothing there tickled my fancy so I left for San Pedro Square Market.  And yes, if you are wondering or gasping, I don&#39;t care for mochis and spending over $3 for a scoop of ice cream is ridiculous to me at the time - seeing how I was trying to obey my strict diet restrictions however.........  I scored a parking spot on the street!  Unlike San Francisco&#39;s new law, San Jose offers free parking on Sundays (and of course everyday after 6PM).  I walked w/ my daughter across the street into San Pedro Square.  I looked to my right and saw Little Cheese Shoppe - a bookmark however, I wanted something I normally can&#39;t do w/ my monster.  I ended up dining at Vino Vino (review tomorrow).    Anyhow... I remember there was a cupcake place that took over the overly priced organic market.  For some reason that particular spot seem to fail no matter what the business is but come on, I am not paying $3 for a mini cupcake at Polkadotz Mini Gourmet Cupcakes.  As much as I&#39;m crazy to drive an hour for a sandwich, at least it was a filling sandwich.  I looked straight ahead and noticed this new stand right in the middle of the dining area.  I couldn&#39;t make out from afar what this stand has but I saw desserts of some sort and hurried over.    They just opened a week ago.  The pastry case was rather empty, in my opinion but I saw what I wanted: Chocolate Ganache Cupcake ($3).  My daughter wanted the Red Velvet ($3).  I see cakes and tarts that resembled the horrible Cocola Bakery plus what turned me off also was the price; $6 for the Chocolate Fantasy.  I am good... for $2 more, that&#39;s the price of my lunch right there.  I can&#39;t knock them down for that. The cakes may be really good.  All of their mousse, cakes, and cheesecakes priced at $6.  They have regular sized cupcakes for $3 (not much variety, just: red velvet, chocolate ganache, and cappuccino), brownies, mini cupcakes, cookies, and pops (truffles, marshmallows, cheesecake).    What I love is the service.  Both ladies were very friendly and welcoming.  I didn&#39;t notice the cookies till after I paid.  The chocolate chip cookies look really good.  I was told they have a chocolate and peanut butter cookies that will be out soon so I told them I&#39;ll be back after my lunch for them.    I LOVE the ganache because it was smooth and rich.  Though the presentation can improve but taste did not suffer.  I liked the frosting but it was little stiff at first.  The cake is a little on the dry side, just a tad but w/ the ganche and frosting, it evened out. I finished it before I reached Vino Vino.  A few stopped me to ask where I got the cupcake and what kind.  I did not try my daughter&#39;s cupcake but I did feel the cake.  It is a weird quirk of mine to feel the cake because I make a big deal when the cupcake is dry.  It just ruins everything... and yes, the cake was super moist according to my index finger.    I&#39;d come back.  I think I&#39;ll come this Friday... I need to eat at 4 more places inside San Pedro Square to complete the entire place (eating and review-wise).  Hmmm.. or I may save that for Saturday because I&#39;ll be a few hours free of the kiddo.  This Friday, I will be at Moveable Feast: Willow Glen.  The trucks there will include:   - Bao and Bowl - BBQ Kalbi - Bigg Shrimp&#39;n (they&#39;re good) - Chairman (they&#39;re goddamn amazing) - Curry Up Now (one of my favorite trucks) - Fairycakes - I NEED TO TRY THIS TRUCK THIS FRIDAY - House of Siam on Wheels - JO&#39; on the GO - KoJa Kitchen - this will probably be my dinner - PSRT  - Sam&#39;s Chowdermobile (I enjoyed their clam chowder) - Takoz Mod Mex (meh) - Treatbot (pretty good ice cream: the 408 is my favorite) - We Sushi  I&#39;m hungry......... *sad Tram* and *hungry Tram*  P.S. I&#39;m sad because I&#39;m hungry =P  
                  LOVE their macaroons!! The staff is super nice and friendly. Macaroons are below average priced. Favorite flavors: Pistachio &amp; Mixed berries.  My boyfriend and I found this place on Yelp. I&#39;ve been to Blush Lounge several times, but didn&#39;t know they expanded the empty space. After stuffing our faces at Amicis, we walked over to San Pedro Square and found Chocatoo. The staff was super friendly and seemed knowledgeable about the desserts for sale. They accept credit card as well, via Square. I was pleasantly surprise to see that the macaroons were priced on the cheaper side.  Overall, love Chocatoo. I&#39;ve gone back for desserts and will be back again! A+++++++++++++++  
                  This review is for chocatoo catering . We ordered a large quantity of macaroons and assorted mousse cups for our wedding dessert bar . It was an absolute hit! Our guests loved them! All our desserts were gone in 15 min. Our absolute favorite is the mango mousse cup and the key lime cup.  Of course the macaroons !! They were the best ! We had an assortment of green tea, chocolate and Raspberry . They were the perfect consistency and some of the finest we have ever tasted . Valerie was awesome to work with and great with suggestions . Our order was ready for pick up right on time and looked great.  
                  This was still being built when i left the country for a while. Now this and a few other things have sprouted in the market. As much as i love the coffe at B2, it&#39;s good to see they have Mr Espresso from Oakland as an alternative. Got a mini cupcake to supplement the snacking with an iced Americano. Good to see a new dessert option in the fold here  
                  This is my favorite place to go in San Pedro Market Square.  The pretty desserts are just so inviting.  However, my favorite thing to order is the Reese&#39;s cookie.  It&#39;s a peanut butter cookies with Reese&#39;s peanut butter cups in it.  HEAVEN!    The service is fantastic and fast.  Just stop by and look.  
                  I came here on a visit from out of town and tried the s&#39;mores cookie, triple chocolate mousse, and a passion fruit italian soda. The cookie was awesome (warm and gooey), the mousse was also great (sturdy, not too sweet, well constructed), but the italian soda was a waste of time. I brought it back because it didn&#39;t have half and half. They told me that they don&#39;t serve italian sodas with half and half, which I thought was an essential ingredient. Turns out, they&#39;re right. An italian soda is just syrup with fizzy water. Adding cream turns it into a cremosa, which is actually a french take on an italian soda. Either way, it was a total rip off. $3.50 for a few pumps of syrup, fizzy water, and a mountain of ice. Seriously, it was probably 8 ounces of water with 12 ounces of ice.  
                  Chocatoo is a cute little kiosk in the middle of San Pedro Square market.  It&#39;s on the same side as Treatbot, btw.  A couple of friends and I met for dessert awhile back.  We tried a carrot cake, &#34;Death by Chocolate&#34;, and a lemon tart.  We also got bottled water.  The desserts were REALLY sweet.  I&#39;m talking, lots and lots of frosting.  There were lots of fun looking goodies in the display cases.  I&#39;ll give Chocatoo another try when I&#39;m grabbing a meal at San Pedro Square, but I probably won&#39;t be making a special trip just to get their sugary treats.  
                  4 stars just for the chocolate chip cookies...actually all their cookies!!  When you approach this little vendor there is a glass case full of desserts!! they LOOK delicious, but they only LOOK pretty...the taste eeh not so much! I tried a cake pop and it tasted old. The lady behind the counter even admitted that they didn&#39;t even make them. :(  BUT don&#39;t walk away yet, because if you see those huge cookies laid out to cool, fall in line and get some!!! My favorite is their regular triple chocolate cookie, which is a huuge cookie with milk chocolate kisses, and two kind of chocolate chips embedded in the cookie! Sooo gooey, and definitely worth the $3!   I would like to come back and try their peanut butter cup one!! And any others!!  The ladies behind the counter are very nice!!  
                  I like elimination brackets, and I like cookies.  So, when my friend asked me to pick out a delicious cookie for his party, I immediately knew I was going to put together a cookie bracket to find the winner.  That winner was the Chocatoo Reeses Peanut Butter Cookie---it distinguished itself immediately from the field (of about 10+, I can&#39;t remember) and completely blasted away its formidable competition.  It&#39;s just a scrumptious cookie through and through...ever so slightly crispy on the edges, soft and chewy throughout, and mind blasting when you get a chunk of Reeses.   Nice work, Chocatoo!  I put in an order for several dozen weeks in advance.  The whole process was a breeze.  Chocatoo was very responsive and helpful over email.  Payment was a super simple e-invoice.  Overall, just great.  Thanks, Chocatoo!  
                  Price is on the high side. I should already have expected that given the location I am at. It was my first time however eating a cake mousse pop. The desert wasn&#39;t too sweet, just right I thought. It&#39;s a nice little treat after a nice meal.  
                  Went in and got my favorite chocolate cupcake. It was drier than I have ever had before. Hope this was a one time glitch. I need cupcakes!  
                  Awesome, awesome and awesome! Great food and customer service. Only place to go when you are in san pedro sq.  
                  All the sweets and baked goods here are presented very nicely and the place smells  good. I usually come here when I&#39;m at San Pedro Square with friends because it&#39;s the only place to fulfill our sweet tooth. I have tried their macarons and they are really good, but very pricey. Their mango raspberry mousse cake was really good too. But everyone comes here for the freshly baked cookies. The chocolate chip cookies were super gooey and tasted so good and chocolate-y. But they&#39;re just simple chocolate chip cookies that anyone can make. What gets me to buy them is that they are overfilled with large chocolate chips and that they are the size of a giant hamburger patty. I will come back to try the peanut butter one. I&#39;ll just have to be prepared to spend a lot of money since everything is overpriced here. I buy 2 or 3 items and it always totals around $10-15.  I had to wait with a bunch of people since the cookies were cooling down. This place gets really packed and crowded. The server accidentally gave me one cookie when I ordered two. Good thing I told her and she put another one in a bag and gave it to me.  
                  My mom and I decided on this place for dessert after walking through the San Pedro market area. They had a couple good looking desserts and my mom wanted to get coffee which they had as well.  I decided to go with the flourless chocolate cake and my mom got a mocha. The cake was very good and had a great richness to it and good flavor as well. The only thing that I would like to have done differently would be some sort of fresh cream topping to finish it off rather than the white chocolate that they serve it with because I didn&#39;t think that it paired very well.  My mom enjoyed her coffee very much and we even were able to meet the owner who was so genuinely nice and has a great Australian accent!  If you&#39;re in the market, make sure to check out this place and try their pastries and coffee.  
                  The last time I was at Blush, the space in this building was completely empty (except for Blush). This time, the building is full of new vendors and eateries that we want to try (The Little Cheese Shoppe, Phonomenal, Chocatoo, and more).   We had just eaten at Little Chef Counter for lunch, and we decided to take a look around before we left. As soon as we entered the building, we immediately came up upon this dessert stand right in the middle of the large room. The case is full of delicious treats - baby tiramisu cups, chocolate mousse, cupcakes, macarons, giant cookies, carrot cake, and more. The prices are pretty hefty - $6 for a slice of carrot cake?? Yipe!  My husband decided he wanted the lemon meringue cupcake and I settled for the mixed berries and raspberry macarons. The macarons are actually pretty decently priced, since each macaron is only $1.25.  The cupcake was a little too sweet, but my husband said that one cupcake was a respectable amount of sweet for him. I touched the frosting on top of the cupcake, and it wasn&#39;t a set meringue yet. But the frosting has the texture of a soft marshmallow, pretty nice.  I don&#39;t know if the macarons are made fresh at Chocatoo, but their texture is really nice. Soft but crisp. They were a bit too sweet, though. After a couple bites, I couldn&#39;t differentiate any distinct flavors but could only tell the macarons were sweeeeeeeet.  I might try this place again after lunch, but the prices are quite the deterrent, since the flavors don&#39;t pack the punch I expected!  
                  I take my cookies very seriously, and I love this place. Anytime I&#39;m driving through San Jose I make it a point to stop for a ridiculously delicious melted cookie.  The peanut butter cup cookie is my favorite, as it has the perfect ratio of chocolate chips to peanut butter. The S&#39;mores cookie is a bit too rich, but I really like it nonetheless.   I&#39;ve been meaning to try the other desserts here, but tend to end up ordering a few cookies instead (no shame)  
                  I love my sweets. The best chocolate chip cookies, especially when they come right out of the oven... all warm and gooey. I&#39;ve seen people circle back eagerly waiting for them to be ready.   As for the other goodies, a few of my faves would definitely be the red velvet and carrot cake cupcakes..oh and don&#39;t forget the lemon tarts and macarons....yum!!  Definitely a great place to appease your sweet tooth.  
                  Really good! Such a nice looking shop and the desserts match! Had a latte and a eclair, very delicious.  
                  I love this place! I have a huge sweet tooth and this place always satisfies it. My husband&#39;s and my guilty pleasure is the reeses peanut butter cookie...YUMMM! I also love the smorcon, chocolate chip cookie, etc etc. I pretty much love everything I have tried and can&#39;t wait to try more....!!  
                  Just being near this place smells like heaven. The cookies are fresh out of the oven and soft and delicious. Don&#39;t walk near this place if you are on a strict diet.  
                  Alright, I&#39;ll be straight with you guys. If you have never experienced a Foodgasm, come to this place!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Their PB cookies.............I need to go back right NOW!!  
                  Very friendly, nice workers and  always freshly baked cookies. Chocolate chip cookies there are the best i have ever tried.  They also make a good coffee there.  
                  I LOVE THESE COOKIES!  Fresh, hot, chewy-gooey chocolaty goodness!    I haven&#39;t tried anything else on the menu. Usually too full to even attempt it.    Maybe I&#39;ll try something else next time I have my elastic waist eatin&#39; pants on.  
                  I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place BUT DO NOT EAT the cookies because you will be addicted!! So good beyond words! Made fresh and still warm! My favorite is the reese one, my kids love the chololate chip.  
                  OCCASION: The boyfriend and I found this dessert place. We both love desserts and decided to try out their red velvet cheesecake and macaroons.   ATMOSPHERE: Chocatoo is located in the dessert/bar/sushi building and in the vary middle of it. There are tables right next to Chocatoo but the boyfriend and I decided to eat our desserts outside.  MACAROONS: My first time eating macaroons and I expected better. The boyfriend said there are better ones than Chocatoo&#39;s. Anyways, the macaroons did not taste very fresh. They tasted like they&#39;ve been in display for days.   RED VELVET CHEESECAKE: I personally love red velvet and cheesecake and was excited to try out this. It was delicious however it did not taste very fresh like the macaroons.   PRICE: Expensive! I didn&#39;t want to try their desserts but the boyfriend insisted. :( $3 for the Red Velvet Cheesecake and $1.25 for 1 macaroon.   CUSTOMER SERVICE: Both ladies seem alright. However the lady that was helping us get our desserts started to cough vigorously and I felt bad. Hope she&#39;s feeling better now. The other lady came by to help us out in her place.   Overall, try Chocatoo if you have the money to. It&#39;s a great dessert place located in San Pedro Square Market. Personally, I think the desserts aren&#39;t very fresh. 4 stars.   NOTE: According to Ann L&#39;s review, she asked Chocatoo a few questions and found out they are made on site but in Sunnyvale.  
                  I love that this place has found its home in San Pedro Square Market. They have tons of delectable desserts to accompany the restaurants here. The other day I had a great stout beer from the Market Beer Store and they recommended to have it with a Peanut Butter Cookie from Chocatoo. And sure enough, the pairing was delicious.   Almost everything I&#39;ve had here has been delicious. The only thing is the other day I ordered a Salted Caramel Cupcake, and it really lacked flavor. The frosting clearly tasted super buttery and that flavor overtook the others. Meanwhile the cake was lacking flavor. Maybe it was an off day. The rest of their stuff is amazing, so definitely give it a try.  
                  Found this amazing, local kiosk at San Pedro Square, and grabbed a cup of their coffee and a chocolate chip cookie...MY GOODNESS. The coffee was phenomenal (they use two shots per cup) and the cookie was one of the best I&#39;ve ever had! The staff was incredibly kind and super fast considering we came on a busy Saturday night. Definitely recommend checking this place out! 5 stars!  
                  I have been coming here for a few months now and I&#39;m IN LOVE!!!! The past 3 weeks I&#39;ve had the S&#39;MORE COOKIE twice a week... its DELICIOUS!! So is the death by chocolate, cake!! I&#39;ve had all the cake pops, where are really tasty and the tarts!  Just come here, enjoy the sweets and support a great local business!! The owners are amazing too! I enjoy coming here because they are always so sweet!!  
                  Came in after having dinner at Los Cubanos, and I&#39;m immediately immersed in this amazingly intoxicating aroma of just baked chocolate chip cookies! I had to order both of them! Triple chocolate chip &amp; peanut butter cup! It was heaven in my mouth, especially because the triple chocolate had just come out of the oven! The cookie was crisp on the outsides &amp; the middle just melted in your mouth! It was cookie perfection!  
                  Their cookies. If you haven&#39;t had them you haven&#39;t lived. Go live!!! And you can&#39;t just order 1. Yolo!!!! They also have other amazing bakery goods.
