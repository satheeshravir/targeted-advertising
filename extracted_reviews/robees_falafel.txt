                  I was in downtown San Jose for a Sharks game and we decided to check out the San Pedro Square Market.  My friend and I picked Robee&#39;s as the place to eat.  I had the Chicken Kebab Salad - pieces of marinated chicken grilled to perfection and served with fresh lettuce, juicy tomatoes, cucumbers and red cabbage.  It was very good.  The chicken was cooked nicely, well seasoned, nice dressing.  Good way to get the kebab without the carbs from rice or pita.  My friend did the chicken kebab plate with rice and pita.  She really liked it.  Big portion, especially of the pita.    Definitely a good option if you are at the market.  The cook each order as it comes in so we did have to wait a bit for the food but it was worth it.  
                  I got the beef shawarma in a wrap with a side of falafel. The presentation is what you would expect from a food court so it was perfectly fine to get it in a basket.   The price was just about right, maybe on the pricey side but my god was it worth it. Best falafel I have ever tasted, and that&#39;s saying something because I live at Rutgers (aka little India).   The shawarma was absolutely spot on. Amazing mixtures of juicy, slightly spicy, and insanely flavorful.  The tomatoes was fresh and provided a nice light taste with the beef.  Just the right about of tzatziki sauce.    Would recommend if you are in the area.  
                  While working in San Jose for a couple of days I was pretty excited to find Robee&#39;s within walking distance of my Hotel as after a 10 hour day eating nothing but Protein products I was in dire need of some Meat and Carbs.  The location isn&#39;t what I expected it to be and upon arriving found it inside San Pedro Square where all of the dining area is communal and of course on a Saturday evening was really busy. Basically you order at the register and they give you a pager to notify you when your food is ready.  I ordered the Chicken Shish which was ready in about 15 minutes which is a fair amount of time and I was told I could help myself to sauces on the side. ( yelp.com/biz_photos/robe… ) The plate was a good size with one skewer of meat, Rice, Salad and Bread. The Salad was fresh and crisp and the Chicken nicely seasoned yet a few of the chunks were very tough and my Bread was barely even luke warm so it was really chewy and the Rice was a little overcooked . Overall it was an &#39;&#39;ok&#39;&#39; meal but found for the quality it was a little overpriced. If I ever find myself back here for food I&#39;ll probably give the Wraps a try instead of the plates.  
                  OK, I&#39;m not a connoisseur of falafel, but I&#39;ve definitely had my share. This was just so, so. It was flavorful but a bit dry and didn&#39;t have the depth that I hope for in really good falafel. No, I&#39;ve not had the authentic type or the homemade type, so I am comparing this to other restaurants I have been to. Service wise, they are friendly and fast.  
                  I&#39;ve been working next to that place for years, and never even stopped to look at Robee&#39;s. One day a few weeks ago my friend insisted that I try their Shwarma plate and since then I&#39;m hooked. I didn&#39;t like the beef shwarma, the meat was a bit too though but the chicken Shwarm is so good I&#39;m willing to eat it every day. it come with tasty Homus, and a salad and rice (can do without the rice), the wrap is great as well. they have this liquid tahini souce and hot sauce to add on top of your plate/wrap, and it adds so much flavor to the whol already flavorful dish. Yummy!!! I really want to try other items in their menu, but every time I go there I see the chicken  shwarma picture and go for the chicken Shwarma again...  
                  Its that time when I have to haul my friends to try something new. Since we always go downtown I thought of swerving away from our usual spot just to experience new good eats!  And so we marched our way to San Pedro Square Market and gone around places where we can browse on different kinds of food preparations. We ended up trying most of the food in Robees Falafel.   My hubby ordered the beef and chicken shish kebob and my friend ordered the beef shawarma with a side of rice and fries. My friend isnt a fan of greens so she was happy that the cashier agreed to put the fries as a side rather than a salad or hummus in her shawarma... Score!!  The shisk kebob was huge and overly filling. It goes well with the green sauce they provided and the meat was tender and well seasoned. Tho I ordered something else from a different vendor my hubby (bless his generous heart!) let me try his food a couple of forkfuls.   My friend enjoyed her rice and fries. She wasnt happy with the meat tho. Despite the loaded beef strips she commented that the meat was dry and the bread cold and tasteless....I told her to dip it in the green sauce, but she gave me a face....LOL! oh well!!!  Over all the portions was decent for the price but the food needs more improvement esp on the shawarma beef.  3.5 stars!  
                  One of the food choices here at San Pedro Square. It was not the best Mediterranean meal I&#39;ve had. I had the falafel and it was a bit on the salty side, and the chicken too which was what DIDDY ordered. I give the experience 3 stars only because it was in the nice setting of San Pedro Square..  
                  This place is perfect for your drunchie fix.  Located in the heart of San Pedro Market, Robee&#39;s is one of the many food stalls inside the indoors square. I decided to get their falafel wrap here because it was one of the cheapest places compared to the other stalls AND because it had vegetarian options. This place is veggie-proved by me!!  Being a little buzzed on the delicious drinks from bars/locales in downtown SJ, Robee&#39;s is great for a little drunk munchin&#39;. The wrap was very yummy--or at least it was after a couple of drinks! The service is quick, almost like food court status at the mall or something.   I have no complaints, and would definitely come back in the future to try other items on their menu.  
                  Walking into San Pedro Square, I was so overwhelmed by all the food choices it has to offer, but Robee&#39;s Falafel caught my attention!   I appreciated the fact that most of the dishes had pictures for me to look at so it made ordering a lot easier for me. I ended up getting the chicken shawarma and I am totes in love! The chicken was very flavorful and juicy and the sauce brought the whole wrap together.   My wrap was packed and I loved that they had extra sauce on the side so you can add as much as you want to your liking without the fear of someone else under/overdressing it. Next time, I really want to try the rice plates and the falafel!   Robee&#39;s Falafel made my stomach so happy!  
                  I got the Ultimate Combo and my wife got the Beef Shish Kabobs. I thought the Falafels were pretty good, crispy, yet airy inside. The beef and chicken was just so-so.  The rice was very good.  If I had to come again, which I probably won&#39;t, I&#39;d stick with then Falafel plate.    My wife&#39;s Beef Kabobs were a little tough, so she was not too happy. She only ate 1 stick.  We&#39;ve had so much better Shish Kabob at places like Chatanoga and Alborz.   It took about 15-20 min to get our food on a slow Sunday afternoon. I can imagine the wait on a Friday night.  Keep in mind, I wouldn&#39;t complain about the wait had I been wow&#39;d by the food...which I wasn&#39;t.   So many other places to try in St Pedro Square, so it may be quite a while for us to ever get back around to this place, if ever.  
                  San Pedro Square Market has an undeniable variety of foods to try out!  This is one place I recommend if you want something beyond the standard fare.  Their Gyro with fries hit the spot!  The beef and lamb filling was delicious and exotic tasting!  The only miss were their Tahini and hot sauce.  Both were a bit running and not as flavorful as I would have preferred.  The hot sauce at Falafel&#39;s Drive In has nothing to worry about!  
                  One of the best restaurants for the price I&#39;ve ever found.  Their falafel wrap is the best falafel I&#39;ve had outside of Israel (though it is Lebanese-style, served in lavosh instead of pita)--I could eat this every day and be happy.  But you need to ask for hot sauce if you want it--the default is to leave it out.  Their chicken shawarma is also excellent.  The beef shawarma, as many others have pointed out, is overdry; especially later in the day, when they&#39;ve kept it warming for too long.  I find it still reasonably tasty, but not the thing I most want to order.  The combination plate (three falafel balls, some chicken and beef shawarma, rice, hummus, pita, and a little salad) is another of my favorites.  A lot of food for a reasonable price.  
                  The chicken shawarma was delicious and there was plenty of food to share with another friend even if you&#39;re hungry. The chicken was diced and seasoned well. The salad had the right amount of dressing. The hot steaming rice brings comfort to your stomach.  Despite how many or few people order here at any given moment, the time you wait for your food is faster than fast food. They handed me a buzzer and as I made just two steps to the seating area, it went off. Were they expecting me?  
                  Fresh Fresh Fresh  Robee&#39;s has been my go-to when ever I&#39;m in the area.  Sometimes I&#39;ll have a meatless day, sometimes not.  The Chicken Shawarma Wrap is lightly seasoned, but loaded with meat! I was surprised!!  I thought of it as eating a Mediterranean Burrito..Really, it really that good!   At times I&#39;ll order a side of Dolma. Grape leaves stuffed with rice and other goodness that I don&#39;t know. I usually order these up after I have had a few beers... Make sure you get some of that spicy ketchup . I like to dip the Dolma in and drizzle it on my Wraps too!  Whoa...Breakfast!! Yes...That have a breakfast wrap! I told them to put every thing in it...Not really,  but it was really great!!  Stop on buy and try something different!  
                  Ordered the gyro (lamb and beef) with a side of hummus and pita bread and it was delicious! I probably waited 5-10 minutes for my food. Friendly staff and I couldn&#39;t get enough of my gyro!  So many tasty things that I still need to try on their menu. Be sure to stop by Robee&#39;s Falafel.  
                  A pleasantly satisfying 5-star lunch yesterday.   One of my New Year&#39;s resolutions is to go meatless on Mondays. But of course I forgot and ate pepperoni pizza on Monday. D&#39;oh! Thought it would be OK to go veggie for lunch yesterday as a repentance of sorts?  Robbie&#39;s serves a GIANT falafel wrap, with the pita bread toasted on the outside. Since French fries technically count as non-meat, enjoyed a piping hot, salty basket as a side.  There&#39;s no way one person could eat a that food for lunch and have a productive day, so it&#39;s recommended to split. $6.50 per person is a cheap meal.  I&#39;m definitely going back!  
                  Definitely a favorite restaurant. The gyro wrap is a must eat, wait, the schwarma on golden colored rice is really good, too! Fresh, hot, tasty tzaziki sauce with the beef, lamb sliced meat. I really like the blend of spices and flavored in each bite. Dip it in the smooth green sauce or light your mouth on fire with the pepper hot sauce. The San Pedro Square Market has lots of food choices and good seating types for you. Enjoy!  
                  The chicken on a stick with salad is very good. The beef on the stick is ok. The service is always good.  
                  The chicken wrap is not as good as I remembered it to be....I found it to be rather on the dry side this time.  Normally, it&#39;s so good...with a lot of sauce and juiciness to the chicken.  :(  On a good note, the portions are generous and the prices are cheap.  You could split one of those wraps in half with a basket of fries and have a good sized meal.  
                  First thing I noticed was this place had the longest line among all the eating spots in San Pedro sq. I can see why.  The gyros was on point along with the lamb wrapped in it. Straight up delicious yo. The sauce even on the side didn&#39;t come through in the taste. Fries on the side were just right for this meal. Missed out on the baklava and will be sure to do it again.  
                  I came here once a long time ago for the veggie plate and was not impressed. Since then, I have come back twice and gotten the falafel wrap deluxe with eggplant both times and it is delicious. I am glad I gave it another try. The wrap is pretty large and I always feel satisfied after. The addition of the eggplant is fabulous, my new favorite thing at San Pedro. I don&#39;t think I will try something else because I like it so much.   The cashiers and the cooks are always friendly too. Try it out!  
                  Went here for a business lunch and ended up having a full plate of lamb gyro, rice, greek like salad, and the bread.  The pita bread is pre-packed and probably the only let down of the meal really.  I wish the rice had more seasoning in it, but the meat was actually pretty delicious.  That was the highlight of the meal.  It takes a little while to cook but it worth the 10-12 min. wait.  I don&#39;t often eat lunch or dinner here but have tried enough of the food here to know that this installment of SPSM is a solid 3 at least.  Maybe ordering a dish without the pita bread might net you a higher overall eating experience.  
                  There are maybe 3 places in San Pedro Square that I usually go, Robee&#39;s is one of them.  Love their chicken wrap and falafel wrap.  Service is slow on occasion, but usually ok.  
                  Everything in San Pedro Market (this is the fourth place I&#39;ve tried so far) receives a similar review from me - I like going to lunch there because it&#39;s a nice environment walking distance from the office with plenty of food options, all of them (including Robee&#39;s) being decently healthy with good portion sizes, but slightly pricey.   However, all I got was the hummus and paid 45 cents after using the discount from the Paypal app. It came in a little plastic container with the Pita Bread on the side. It &#39;twas delicious! Maybe not anything exceptionally unique, but I&#39;m a big fan of hummus and this definitely satisfied my cravings. The texture of the hummus was perfectly smooth, and there was enough after finish the bread to easily bring home for later. The normal price would be about $5, which if you bought a container and bread in a store it would probably cause that much anyways (I&#39;m assuming this is at least a bit more fresh).   The workers are nice, my food came out fairly quickly, and overall the experience was worthwhile.  
                  I was tempted by shwarma, but the server recommended the chicken kabab salad, and I agree it&#39;s worth waiting a little longer for the kabab.  The chicken was marinated well, not too dry, and the salad is a pretty big portion.   You can get sauces to go on the side of their counter.  They also had nice cucumber water (free - ask for a cup).  
                  This is one of the best Mediterranean places in San Jose, they have a variety of great exotic dishes with wonderful flavor. Beef Kabobs are the best!! Stop by and have a wonderful meal .... You won&#39;t regret it!  
                  This location is inside the San Pedro&#39;s Market Square, not bad, definitely not terrible. But you&#39;re left with an overall feeling of wanting something more.  Their wraps are priced correctly, because I&#39;ve been to places that serves wraps (I&#39;m looking at you Castro Street!) and they overcharge like crazy, give me something on this side of the market, and I&#39;m square. The problem is that mine seemed to have lacked the flavor that the splurged-out location on Castro Street provided. Naturally, this is less of a fine dine, and more of a sit-n-go spot.  It&#39;s great for a quick lunch snack, but I feel that in the San Pedro Market Square, I was left yearning for a bit more.  But, you all know my policy, if it&#39;s three stars or less, I will always come back and do an updated review! So don&#39;t worry, as in the Terminator... &#34;I&#39;LL BE BAHHCCCKKK&#34;  
                  It&#39;s not the best, but it will do. Ordered the chicken schwarma salad. Chicken is not dry but it&#39;s not something I&#39;ll crave. It will do. Just do.  I&#39;ll tell you though, the service is great. Friendly and quick.  
                  SO GOOD! I&#39;m happy to see a variety of food in the San Pedro Market Square where everyone can find what they want and eat a different place every visit.  It was so satisfying and good portion sizes. $23 for two full meals and both of us were satisfied, but not overly stuffed.  We ordered: Gyro Plate - Big strips of gyro meat, rice, salad Chicken and beef shawerma wrap - a good balance of chicken to beef Dolma - sweet and tangy (in a good way)  I would definitely eat here again.  
                  I&#39;m hooked on this place!!! It is right now my favorite place to eat at San Pedro Market. They have one of the best french fries I ever had! My usual order here is the gyro with french fries! Yum! They also have a great selection of drinks which surprisingly most places at the Market don&#39;t have.  The reasons why it got 4 stars versus five is because I think the prices are a little pricey, the food can SOMETIMES take long and the salads suck here.  
                  3.5 to be exact. I had the lamb gyro which comes with your choice of fries or salad (I got salad) the lamb itself was pretty salty and did not have enough tzatiki sauce to cover up the slight dryness of it but overall not a bad gyro. The men working were very nice so I&#39;ll give them the extra half star :)  
                  San Pedro Market is a really great place for me and my coworkers to grab lunch. On Fridays the farmer&#39;s market is usually going on, but it has stopped for the season. So today was just a good day to enjoy some Mediterranean food and soak up the sun.   I had the gyro wrap, which was pretty standard. Pita was a little hard on the edges from over-grilling it. I do wish they had lamb shawarma, because it&#39;s my favorite when it comes to Mediterranean. The price was ok--pretty average for a gyro wrap ($8) with fries or salad.   It&#39;s good if you&#39;re ever craving falafels, gyro, or shawarma.  
                  The falafels are money.    Money for the pretty green insides of the perfectly fried crusty brown shell.  Ordered these poppers many times and I swear the cook fries them so perfectly that there are just fractions of seconds away from being burnt.    The great thing about these Mediterranean hush puppies is that they always come out hot.  Other places pre-fry em so they come out mealy and without character.  Robbie comes super correct - hot and steamy on the inside but toasty and with some eventful grit on the outside.   Well done Robbie, well done.  
                  I wandered around SPMS for a good ten minutes on a Sunday afternoon. I didn&#39;t know what I wanted to eat. Nothing sounded really good, nothing sounded bad either. I finally decided on Robee&#39;s Falafel for my lunch.   I looked over the menu for a couple of minutes, as I wasn&#39;t sure what I really wanted to eat. I was unsure of whether I should order both chicken kabobs or throw in a beef kabob. I finally decided on the chicken plate.   It did take a few minutes for my order to come out, but when it finally did, I was ready! There was a good amount of food on the plate. There were 2-3 skewers of chicken, the pita bread, rice and salad. The only thing that it didn&#39;t come with was the traditional yogurt type sauce. And the pita bread was a little thin for my liking. But other than that, everything else tasted really good.   They had a lot of items to choose from. I&#39;d probably venture out and try something different the next time I eat there.  
                  Review from a vegetarian.  This place has so many options!  I love that you can get a wide variety and combination of items here.  I love the falafel wrap with the eggplant in it.  Their falafel is flavorful and not dry! Their dolmas and hummus are also pretty good, and the tabouleh is not bad.  You can&#39;t beat the sauce options.  The folks working here have always been nice to me too!  Downsides: it&#39;s a little pricey and their tzatziki is a little bland.  
                  Exploring San Pedro Square more and decided to check out Robees. I got the basic falafel wrap which was decent. I added the red and light green sauces they have at the counter to make it more flavorful.     I am sure I will be trying other things on their menu in the near future.  
                  For me, this is the highlight of San Pedro Market. I place a large to go order every Friday, and they are so friendly, and the order is always correct (a miracle it seems these days). The food is fresh, tasty, well seasoned, and the plates are very generous--something you can&#39;t say about most of the eateries here.  
                  I have never had a greek food but for a small to go place it was good, if you combined the hummus with the chicken and rice. The chicken was kind of dry and the rice had no flavor. My co-workers had gotten something different which they liked and to me it looked a whole lot better. Maybe next time I will try something diff.  
                  Nothing better than a gyro from this place for lunch great food and really great service. The place is like a food stand in the market at San Pedro and man I thought some of the other places in here were good but this place takes the cake Awesome food keep up the good work gents  
                  Decided to to grab dinner at San Pedro Squares with my girlfriends and came across Robee&#39;s Falafel. The plating looked delicious and the serving size was quite huge. We ordered the Chicken Schawarma, Beef Schawarma and Felafel&#39;s combo.   Because I did not want their rice, I asked them to substituted for some hummus instead. I was glad they did since there was overwhelmingly pile of meats on my plate that I do not think I would had finished if I had the rice. As it turned out, the beef and chicken schawarma was on the dried side which made it tough to eat. I love falafel, but somehow this place did not satisfied my palate.   Overall, a decent place to eat with great portion size and price. However, they need to not overcooked their meats because nobody wants to feel like they&#39;re chewing on rubbers.  
                  Was in the San Jose area a few weeks back and was looking for a place to grab a quick bite. After browsing my trusty yelp app I decided to give Robee&#39;s Falafel a try.  I opted for the combo platter so I could try a little bit of everything. For under $12 the amount of food is easily shareable for 2! It came with salad, rice, 1 falafel, heaping portion of chicken and beef shwarma plus pita bread!  Salad: dressed well and tasted fresh Rice: cold, could taste the seasoning in the rice Falafel: crisp exterior, relatively dry interior, spices were noticeable but wasn&#39;t special Meat: heavly seasoned, copious amount, chicken was dry Pita Bread: standard bread  Overall Thoughts  Robee&#39;s Falafel delivers middle of the road mediterranean cuisine for a great value  
                  Nothing particularly special about the food here, but it was one of the better (or perhaps only) vegan options at San Pedro Square. I mean, even when falafel isn&#39;t that great, it&#39;s still good, right?  
                  It was my first time. I ordered the Falafel plate with slight hesitation because the beef and chicken schwarma looks appetizing on that metal rod often used in Latin meat dishes. Other reviews indicated the hummus was too salty, but it was not. I thought it had a bit too much tahini paste.  The falafel was crispy and creamy in the center, because I&#39;ve had drier falafel. But, honestly I&#39;ve had better falafel in San Jose, overall compared to Robee&#39;s. The falafel was loaded with sesame seeds which overpowered the falafel. I love sesame seeds, but that was an overload. I want to go back to try the meat plates. I&#39;m down for another spin  
                  Decent food choices in San Pedro Square. There&#39;s a lot of seating and it would probably be a good place for groups (plus they have a bar).   Got a Chicken Schwarma Wrap and it was okay but nothing spectacular. I always seem to be let down by Mediterranean places nowadays. I always expect an explosion of flavor and get something more bland and just plain, normal.  Anyways, I would probably try out the other palces in the food court-ish area before trying robee&#39;s again. Mediterranean is always my food type of choice, but Robee&#39;s just doesn&#39;t live up my internal standard for it.  
                  Everything about this screams mediocre. The falafel was dry and kinda mushy, the veggies in the wrap weren&#39;t really fresh, and it took a while to get my order despite being the only one there. All in all, go somewhere else if you&#39;re in the mood for good falafel. This tastes like they toned it down due to it&#39;s location.  
                  Everything was great!! I ordered the steak kabobs if I remember correctly. Salad was very fresh, the rice was cooked perfectly, and the meat and vegetables were very nicely seasoned and grilled. My only complaint is that the meat pieces are a little too large to eat without cutting a few times.  
                  Had the chicken and beef skewers with rice, salad and pita. Sauces were good. Chicken was tender, streak was tasty, a little tough, salad fresh.  Didn&#39;t have salt and pepper available, had to ask and wait for it. Good thing is the bar is just across the way with a good looker. Stone pale ale.  
                  Probably the best falafel place I have ever tried! I have had nearly everything on the menu and it never disappoints!  My go to: Lentil soup and homemade baklava... YUM!  
                  I would like to think that I am a normal looking girl; not stunning, not too shabby, and definitely and hopefully not funny looking. So yes. I am a normal girl having dinner w/ one of my best friends whom I haven&#39;t seen in months. Angel C. ordered steamed mussels at Little Chef Counter and an order of poutine fries for me.   Since I want to try everything at San Pedro Square, I turned around and was immediately enticed by this falafel joint. The menu is pretty extensive and knowing my tendencies to order everything, I basically &#34;eenie meanie mynee moe&#39;d&#34; it and got the beef and chicken shawarma. Why? Because it had both beef and chicken, that&#39;s why? Though I have gone months being a lacto-ovo, I am a carnivore. I almost typed &#34;dinosaur&#34;, haha. Although I would not mind being &#34;Little Foot&#34; but long necks are leaf eaters!!! The guy that took my order knew I would butcher the name of this dish so he helped me by saying it but because I am an airhead, I already forgot how to pronounce it. Oh well. The line wasn&#39;t long and the wait was about 5 minutes and OMG, for $7 something, the freaking wrap was freaking huge! My friend&#39;s order did not arrive yet but I was waiting to dig in so badly.   The beef and chicken.. distinctive taste and tender.. both were incredibly flavorful w/ just the right amount of vegetables. Now for those that know me, I do not eat vegetables but if it is diced and I can&#39;t see it then I will devour it. Since the wrap tasted yummy, I didn&#39;t bother to try and find out what exactly was I eating.   Now back to the first paragraph about being normal. The place was packed as usual and about 80% through our meal, Mr. Monster (my kiddo) decided to be Mr. Punk Ass but a cute one, nonetheless. He was getting fussy so I held him. I hate when parents let their damn kids run amuck and/or cry.. &#34;Shut your kid up, please&#34; is what I would normally say in my head when a kid ruins my experience. But yes.. after a few attempts to grab my phone, my fork, the napkins, my plate.. he decided to spit up on my shoulder.. on my jean jacket!!! My hair was not effected but thanks to that mini episode, the table next to us and the folks sitting at the bar watched, smiled, and laughed... I was laughing myself but now I am unsure if those folks were laughing at me or w/ me. Haha!!! Either ways.. I definitely got the attention. Blah.   Am awesome dinner at an awesome place w/ an awesome pal!  I wish I live in downtown for SPSM. Now I am home after a great meal and I have Man vs. Food on... can it get any better? Yes, it could. I am missing cupcakes. Now back to responsibilities and chores... when is it Friday?!  
                  Went to lunch at Robee&#39;s Falafel on Wed 1/25/12.  It&#39;s in the new San Pedro Market that&#39;s coming along, still got lots of unopened places.  It&#39;s just a food stall you order your food then someone brings it to you.  Tables &amp; chairs nearby.  I got:  lentil soup $4 - a bowl of soup I thought was tasty enough.  Chicken sharwarma wrap I found the meat very dry, not enough hummus in it, some tomato slices, lettuce - it&#39;s huge though.  Baklava $2 - too sweet on the bottom, otherwise just ok.  I wish I got the Veggie wrap - maybe next time.  Water - can get your own from the pitcher they had.  Special they had was Gyro sandwich w/ fries $7.99.  I charged it.  
                  Nice gal working the counter. Great first impression. Great location that it&#39;s in! I saw some falafels being made so I decided to order some. I also ordered some of the chicken. The chicken was just that...chicken. Nothing special and a bit on the dry side. The falafels were decent. They were HUGE, which I appreciated lol. A bit on the dry side but that&#39;s okay for falafel. Not bad but I have had better and because it is so close to me as well as in a good location, I would come here again!  
                  Falafel was terrific, the French Fries to.die.for and the side salad was generous and flavorful. Good price for a good amount of food. My SOLE issue: have some tahini on hand or toss in as an extra, would you? I asked for some, was willing to pay, but was informed that the green stuff in the squeeze bottle was tahini. Please. I&#39;m Middle Eastern. Bottle contents were a watery-cilantro concoction, no tahini to be found. At all.  
                  My mother and I decided to grab lunch here after walking the Silicon Valley Heart Walk for the American Heart Association, so you can imagine how hungry we must&#39;ve got. Dining in the San Pedro Market was also a good opportunity to validate our parking as well, so why not kill two birds with one stone?  Since it was still technically breakfast time at Robee&#39;s we decided on getting the Beef Shawarma Breakfast Platter and sharing it. The meal came with pita bread, beef, scrambled eggs and their country style potatoes. The plate was largely portioned, freshly made and delicious! Although we shared, we still didn&#39;t finish our entire meal and ended up boxing it. The potatoes were delicious, seasoned perfectly with a little bit of heat and was very comforting. The beef was seasoned well, but a little on the dry side in my opinion but tasted fine.  For less than $10, we had a meal to feed both of us and extra to bring home. Really excited to try their hummus and Shawarma. I love hummus to death, it&#39;s often misunderstood to my peers and I&#39;ve been wanting to try Shawarma, you can thank The Avengers for the latter.   I&#39;ve gotten a small taste of Robee&#39;s Falafel and I&#39;m a fan!  
                  this is one of many, many vendors inside of the san pedro square market.  since one of my friends ordered from here, i decided to follow suit since the plates looked pretty healthy and prices were reasonable.  since i was hungry, i immediately asked the cashier which dishes would be ready the soonest, and she described the ones which were the quickest to prepare.  i opted for the chicken shawarma lunch plate, which consisted of chicken shawarma, basmati rice, green salad w/dressing, and 2 large pieces of toasted pita.  for $9.49, i thought this was a good amount of food.  re the taste, well, as nicely presented as it all was, the taste could have been better.  the chicken was definitely seasoned well, as i saw the herbs and spices in black, white, and red, covering the pieces of chicken, but i struggled to taste these garnishes and the meat tasted a bit dry.  the rice was just ok, i was glad that it wasn&#39;t oily, but it didn&#39;t have too much of a taste.  the salad was ok, add a little vinaigrette to the greens and tomato and it was pretty good and the tomatoes were definitely fresh.  since i was full from the chicken, rice and salad, i ended up taking the pita bread to go.  when i got home, my hubby dunked the pita in a batch of hummus and said that it was good.  overall, i was happy with the amount of food that i got and the price that i paid, but the taste definitely needed some improvement.  
                  I came here on a Friday night and though San Pedro Square is usually packed, I still got my order quickly. If you&#39;ve ever been to San Pedro Square you know that it&#39;s basically a food court/lounge type of place. So there are no real sit down &#34;restaurants&#34; but more so food vendors with open communal seating. And like all &#34;food courts&#34; it&#39;s usually pretty loud depending on the number of people, so Friday and Saturday nights can be packed and loud.   Robee&#39;s Falafel sells Mediterranean cuisine. I didn&#39;t look at the full menu, mainly just zoomed in on salads (because I already was stuffed from Happy Hour I was at earlier). They had a variety of salads to choose from. Usually I lean towards &#34;Greek Salad&#34; so that&#39;s what I ordered. I also got a side of falafel (5 pieces per side order). The cashier said it would be about 10 minutes, I was a little bummed it would be so long, but luckily it was much shorter than anticipated.  My Greek Salad was HUGE! Lots of toppings (red and green bell peppers, olives, feta cheese, can&#39;t remember if there was more), lots of lettuce, but sadly not enough dressing. I added sauces they had at the counter, one was a spicy chili-pepper sauce and the other was a herb hummus kind of sauce. Both with my salad and falafel were DELISH! I think a prefer the falafel more than the salad just because the salad was wayy too big for me and I wish the bell peppers were grilled instead of fresh. If I go back I&#39;ll for sure get the falafel and maybe share a salad. Robee&#39;s is a great place for Mediterranean food and I would like to eventually try other things on their menu.  
                  Yummiest food ever everything was soooo tasty and the workers were really friendly if your in San Pedro this is the spot to eat... I recommend the beef shawarma plate!  
                  Looks like a legit gyro place....got the wrap and they put a ton of good meat in it - definitely hit the protein craving.  Tasted good too....overall a solid choice in the San Pedro Square Market.   Service was a little slow, but not a big deal.  
                  Among a collection of culinary performers at The San Pedro Square Market resides this little gem, serving tasty Middle Eastern foodstuff.   You will recognize the menu and most of the items as the Valley&#39;s dotted with similar menus.  What sets them apart is the quality and freshness of their items for consumption.  From the dolma, humas, and tabbouleh to the chicken shawarma and falafel balls everything was fresh and tasty.  This is an inside food stand among several others; so, get their early or come after the lunch hour so you can get comfortable seating.  The Market is very busy at lunch time and getting a good seat could be a little frustrating; but, the wait is worth it.  Chasing good food has it rewards and as a first timer to Robee&#39;s Falafel in The Market will expose you to other food stands that looked and smelled like inspiration for a return trip to sample other places.  I know I&#39;ll be back to The Market soon to graze the corridors and munch some goodies.  
                  So I just got back from Israel and I am on a quest to find a falafel as good as the ones I had in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, or even Nazareth! I love food challenges.  I&#39;ve been to Robee&#39;s a bunch of times before my trip but I was really anxious to see how they compared when I got home. It&#39;s a damn good falafel; nice and crispy on the outside but soft and bright green on the inside. Oh yeah, it&#39;s good.   The only thing that ruined the experience was the pita. You are killing me with the pita bread. I&#39;ve had a lot of pita in my life time. I&#39;ve had pita in the middle of nowhere in Egypt that probably had been sitting out for hours and it was still better than Robee&#39;s pita.  I love veggie/dolma wrap and the Mazza plate is out of this world (just work on the pita and we&#39;ll be cool). My boyfriend usually gets the chicken shawarma plate and says it really good!  
                  The people behind the counter here are super friendly. They are always willing to help and explain something if you don&#39;t quite know what it is on the menu. Nice people.  What we swallowed:  BEEF SCHAWARMA: Good flavor. The meat was a bit on the dry side tho.  BAKLAVA: It looked a bit dry but it still had the nice honey gooey-ness. This was tasty.  The food was OK.  
                  I am actually pretty surprised about this place. I can&#39;t really speak for the service since I always come during lunch or around a lunch hour so they always seem to be ready and fairly professional in handling the customers / business.   I would like to praise their chicken. It&#39;s very rare that a heavily seasoned chicken with lots of spices etc. can be so delicious, so juicy. I commend them for using white meat chicken chunks, and the price is actually just right since when you buy a large sandwich from Togo&#39;s or Quizno&#39;s it will run you upwards of $8-10 depending on what you get anyway.   The rice, etc. veggies... wrap... I don&#39;t know, but their chicken? Dead on. And I know my chicken since I make it basically ... day in and day out! I really like this place. Get the chicken plate!  
                  this little stand in the San Pedro Square Market food court is pretty good. we got the ultimate plate ($10) which comes with both chicken and steak schewarma, salad, rice and falafals. you get a couple pieces of pita bread but no hummus. so we had to order a side of hummus which is a plateful and comes wih a ton of pita bread.  the food was good, the only thing i didn&#39;t like too much was the chicken schewarma which we both thought was a bit on the dry side.   one thing i noticed about the food stands here is that most of them have ice water with cucumber dispensers at each stand. which is nice compare to having to drink tap water.  seating is like many food courts but if you&#39;re lucky, you may be able to nab one of the 3 comfy booths.  
                  Whenever I come to San Pedro Square Market, one of my go to places will be Robee&#39;s Falafel. Each time I go to Robee&#39;s, I always order the lamb gyro and fries to go with it. So delicious! I like how their pita wrap is perfectly grilled each time. And they definitely do not skimp on the meat provided! I really like the sauce that goes with it. Super tasty and a good mixture of flavors. The gyro is super filling and I really like that it&#39;s not too overwhelming or heavy after I eat it. I always get too full after eating half of my gyro that I save the rest for later with my fries! The price is fair and reasonable. During the lunch rush, there is usually a pretty long line, but it moves rather quickly. Even with the long line, I only have to wait about 10 minutes to receive my food.  
                  Tried this place out when we visited the market.  It was pretty damn good!  Tried a combo-type plate with chicken, lamb and falafel. Everything was good.  Would come again when craving!  
                  The falafel sandwich is A+. I think they use cilantro in it. I dunno. But yum.  The baklava is also on point. Way to go, Robee&#39;s.  As an aside, I once got the falafel plate, and the falafels seemed dry to me. Don&#39;t know if they have improved their recipe, or if I just went on a better day this time. Either way, I&#39;ll definitely be going back.  
                  The food is inconsistent.  The hummus can be amazing and creamy or watery.  The saffron rice has been bland on all of my visits.  I want to love this place, but there are too many places that are consistently delicious in the market.  
                  I had the beef Shawarma (sp? that&#39;s how it&#39;s spelled on the receipt!) wrap. Just found out that Shwarma is tritip beef (I&#39;m not from California). It was very good and abundant in its serving size for the price. The only weird thing is that though they display the rotisserie style chicken &amp; Shwarma (as most Gyro type of places do) they don&#39;t slice the meat off of them - they use precut, precooked strips of meat :(.  The girl at the register was very patient &amp; sweet as she answered my 20 questions that I had for her.  The Tahini sauce and the Humus topping was excellent - I asked them to put them on the side just in case they were gross since they were each dairy free!  
                  Having eaten at the one in Sunnyvale a number of times,I do know that the falafels are solid right out of the kitchen. We were doing some food hopping in the San Pedro Square Market and got a side of falafels with our other food. Crisp on the outside, moist inside. Well seasoned and ultimately flavorful. The folks who work at the stand area really nice and will find you if you&#39;re sitting outside of their immediate area.  
                  The abundance of resturants in San Pedro Market makes it a cool place to chill and hang with friends or even take that special someone on a date. *wink wink*  I have been here twice and enjoyed the food both times. First time i had the regular Gyro and I thought the meats were well seasoned and cooked. I love the option of fries or salad (of course I have to watch what I eat so I have to get the salad instead..boo hoo) But I recently had the chicken gyro and thought that the chicken was spot on juicy and flavorful. My compadre got a side of the chick peas and I must say they were AMAZINGLY good. I am becoming a huge fan of falafels now. I wish I found out I liked them earlier!  
                  I have frequented this establishment since it first opened. Their menu is pretty decent, the food is always good, the staff is friendly and consistent. I enjoy their large falafel-so crisp and delicious and is perfectly complimented with the blend of vegetables they put in the lavosh bread before they toast it. Their beef shwarma is perfection and they take the extra time to toast my pita bread when I order hummus. My guilty pleasure is their baklava which is always perfectly honey soaked and stuffed with pistachios. Gotta have it!!!  
                  Their hummus is unmissable and cravable. True, the pita wasn&#39;t served warm... so get some falafel instead. Ours was crunchy and hot and fresh, well-seasoned as well, and it has sesame seeds mixed all through the batter, which was unique and amazingly delicious.  The prices are reasonable ($4 for a substantial amount of hummus, $5 for 5 falafel balls)... Get your order to go and sit outside in the sunshine. It&#39;s the kind of experience that will make you fear living anywhere else in the world.  
                  Grabbed lunch here with a friend.  Love the space and the San Pedro Market in general.  I like the open, communal space for eating.  Service was fast and friendly and food was ok.   I got a combo shawarma plate and my friend got the combo kabob plate.  Both came with good salad, rice and pita.  I think it would have been better with hummus or something to add to the plate besides the green sauce given in a squeeze bottle at pick up.  The meat was a bit too salty for my taste and the hot sauce was a bit runny, but it might have just been an off day.  I will, however, be back to taste the other options.  
                  Awesome hummus. Pita bread was warm and soft.   The combo beef shawerma, chicken, and falafel rice plate: The falafel was hot and crispy. The rice was so good...seasoned with spices and buttery. The side salad was a nice break from the heaviness of the meal.  
                  I really had no expectations for this place when my boyfriend suggested it but it really surprised me.  It&#39;s about $9 a plate, which isn&#39;t cheap but it&#39;s still cheaper than other things in the San Pedro area. You get generous portions also which is great.  I usually order the Beef and Chicken Shawerma Combo Plate here. It comes with a salad, pita bread, and delicious rice.  I still haven&#39;t decided which meat I like more so I always order both. The meat can be a tiny bit dry but that&#39;s why they offer great sauces I think.  Whatever is in that green sauce is godly. It&#39;s delicious and addicting, it&#39;s a must try with whatever you order at this place!  As for service, I really have no complaints. I&#39;m very happy with this place and I&#39;ll be back :)  
                  Robee&#39;s is a solid offering at San Pedro Market. It&#39;s got a great selection of vegetarian/vegan items and has all your key Mediterranean presentations (wraps, kebabs, rice plates, etc.). Last time, I ordered a chicken shawarma, and while I didn&#39;t think the chicken itself was anything to write home about, I appreciated the quality of the ingredients and the overall portion of the wrap.   What does it for me is the falafel here. It is perfectly crisp and gives off plenty of flavor from the filling. It works great inside the wrap, but even as tempted as I am to find some other items on the menu to try out, I will at least order a side of 5 falafel balls to complete my meal (best to split them between two people I&#39;d say).   As I notice with plenty of local biz sites, Robee&#39;s needs to update its menu on its website. Other than that, check it out if you&#39;re in the &#39;Square.  
                  I love going to San Pedro Square Market. The wait at Robee&#39;s can be a bit long, especially during the weekday lunch rush, but it is worth it. Robee&#39;s is a solid 3 stars for consistency and service.   I had the falafel pita the last time I was here, and my husband had the chicken shawerma (not sure on the spelling - so sorry). I love the tzatziki sauce so much, I wanted even more on the side to dip my pita in.   My husband&#39;s wrap was delicious as well. When I was trying his wrap, I kind of thought it was like a Middle Eastern panini - yes, it&#39;s a wrap, but it&#39;s been grilled like in a panini press or something, because it&#39;s all golden crispy from some kind of grill on the top and bottom of the wrap. This adds an element of deliciousness that is amazing. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s how it&#39;s supposed to be or not, but we&#39;ve had the same menu item from other restaurants/stands before, and it is not &#34;grilled&#34; in this same manner.   Service was prompt but patient if you are having trouble deciding. However, try to be mindful of the people in line behind you.  The wait can be a bit long, if you get here at the wrong time. Also, finding a seat can be tough here.   Why only three stars? The food, while tasty, was a bit mild for me, like they&#39;re holding back on the spices for us non-Middle-Eastern eaters. Definitely need more flavor; I wonder how authentic the food is? I had to put on sauce and hot sauce on every bite.  I like that there is a Middle Eastern place in the San Pedro Square Market, because I like the variety of cuisines offered, but I think they need to be much more assertive with their flavors here. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s possible with a chain, though.
