                  Wonderful selection of wine and appetizers for happy hour~  Cheese + meat plate includes 2 cheese and 2 meat. The cheese we picked were soo good and creamy. Brie cheese goes so well with a slice of apple, bread and some honey.   We also had the brie fig crostini and it was definitely another good choice of appetizer.   Two glasses of wine, cheese plate and the crostini came out to be $40. Fairly priced  Recommended!  
                  Happy Hour.  Wine wasted.  Charcuterie board.  Bruschetta.  A great catch up session with my girlfriends nibbling on some meat, sipping on fine wine, and having a great time.   Thank you for a wonderful time Vino Vino. Your staff is amazing!   I hope you give this delightful happy hour place a try. Cheers!  
                  Vino Vino is a little restaurant tucked away in Downtown San Jose. My brother and his girlfriend introduced me to this charming little place one Sunday lunch. We had some great food. Here are the details:  Grilled truffle cheese panini- This was one of the best paninis I&#39;ve tasted! I loved the truffle flavor, mushrooms, and crispy bread! It was divine! The size of the panini was a little on the small side though! I think I could have eaten another one!   The side salad- I was not a fan of the side salad because the dressing was very lemony. I found the taste to be quite strong and did not think it complemented the meal.   Overall, I loved Vino Vino! Their paninis are great and definitely worth trying if you are in the neighborhood. I wouldn&#39;t come with a huge appetite because the servings are on the small side- but oh so very tasty!  
                  This is a nice little wine bar inside of San Pedro Market. Great food selection to go with your wine. Some of the more by the glass wines were ok. Not the best, but not bad. I would say to make a decision together, and split a bottle of the better stuff. Fresh good food.  
                  Cute little wine bar in downtown San Jose. We were walking around after a movie trying to find a place to grab a drink and a snack, Downtown San Jose was a ghost town on a sunday afternoon. A lot of places weren&#39;t even open, we actually didn&#39;t think Vino Vino was open from the outside but luckily it was open and not at all crowded. We grabbed a couple of seats at the bar and were brought menus right away. They have a lot of wines by the bottle as well as the wines on tap available by the glass. We had the olives, the burrata and a charcuterie plate. Everything came out very quickly which was nice. They had a decent food menu so you could definitely come and enjoy a meal here, it seems like it&#39;d be a great lunch spot. I am happy we stumbled across this little gem!  
                  Went here on a FriDATE with my boo. Part of the downtown SJ scene. Just was walking down the street and stumbled upon this place in the evening.   I was attracted to the industrial looking tableware and the bottles of wine on display. I can&#39;t resist wine. We were also looking for a small bite prior to our crawl and this place was perfect after looking at the menu.   We ordered a side of olives, $3. And what came out where two types of green sour olives which had the pits in them. Just to nibble at.  We also ordered the cheese and meat plate, $15ish, you can choose two cheeses and two meats from the choices provided. We just selected the options from which sounded the most foreign and complicated to pronounce off of the menu. It comes with some bread, slices of apple, grapes, honey, and a red cranberry looking purée/jelly spread. The combination of the cheeses and meats were interesting and we kept trying to describe what we were tasting. It was fun to mix and match the different flavors together and sip on the wine.   He ordered a watermelon wheat beer which was pretty delish, clean and light, something I&#39;d actually drink and I don&#39;t have a preference for beer. I ordered a glass of Pinot noir. One thing I was disappointed in was that their selection of wines was not comprehensive. You&#39;d think it being a wine bar they&#39;d have everything but not a single moscato on the menu as well as proper wine glassware.   Our bill came out to like $35 without tax. Next time I want to get the wine flight which is 4 2oz pours of their wine on tap. I really like the casual ambiance and food selection. Prices were fair as well.  
                  Small place. Has 2 flat screen TVs. Early in the evening don&#39;t need a reservation. I can see how you could later in evening. Lots of small plates for sharing. Liked fig bruschetta a lot. My husband &amp; I ordered the wine flight. No bad selections. My favorite was The Lost Weekender &amp; the Alpha. I tend to like blended reds. The Harvester Chardonnay was good.  Appetizers: edamame was very ok. Olives-2 selections of green. Too strong for me. DH liked. The paninis were delicious. We had the grilled cheese &amp; the ham &amp; cheese. Cute find. I would come back.  
                  Casual wine &amp; cheese board spot in the San Pedro market!!  if you get the chance try to snag the seating on the outside patio since it&#39;s way cuter and probably more enjoyable, we sat inside since all the outside tables were occupied  i wasn&#39;t super impressed by the options but it&#39;s a nice change from the other more grab and go type places inside the San Pedro market  
                  I made reservations online, which was super easy to do. They also give free appetizer to first time visitors if you sign up online. Check out the website. We got the salmon crostini for our freebie.  I ordered the cheese and meat plate with some wine. Since I am such a newbie at this, I ask the waitress for her suggestions. She really knows her stuff! We ordered Mt. Tam and Humboldt Fog cheese with prosciutto and smoked ham meat. We drank Cabernet Sauvignon (Sensorium, Santa Cruz). Delicious!  The atmosphere is very laid back like a beer bar ?(pub), but a little classier. Not as loud as those bars, so no shouting needed. :) Great experience! Will come back soon!  
                  I went there with my BF to watch the game and it was a wonderful experience!  Lea , our server was super attentive and sweet. She made me feel very welcome with all my questions since I felt like a noob. The cheese and meat platter was delicious ! Along with the smoke salmon crostini . Lea also let us try 5 different kinds of wine before actually choosing a glass .   I would definitely come back since they have a huge screen and the place feels cozy.  
                  I came here and ordered a panini and a red wine flight ($15 for 2 oz of 4 wines) and thought that both were A-OK. I was thrown off when I first entered the place because the servers looked at me like I was inconveniencing them. I think they were confused when I walked in because they didn&#39;t realize I was looking for a table.   I do like the ambience of this place. It is super small and is inside San Pedro Square Market. You can enter from the street side or through the Square Market.   Their menus include paninis, charcuteries &amp; salads. I tried the fig, brie, prosciutto panini with a side salad with balsamic vinaigrette ($9) &amp; thought it was  good but not outstanding. I would like to try their dessert paninis the next time I come.   What I liked about their wine flight was that you could choose any of the wines in your choice of 4. They have over 20 options to choose from which is great for those who like to try a variety of wines.  
                  Vino Vino has more wine options than food options, but they do both very well. The food was well-proportioned and delicious, and hit the spot.  My only dislike was that we were sat at a table that was way too close to the surrounding tables on both sides. It felt like those people were in our party, and so there was no privacy and I often felt uncomfortable. It&#39;s pretty small in there though, with all high top tables, but I suppose they do what they can do. It&#39;s definitely not an intimate experience.  I had the strawberry almond chicken salad, and it was great! We also tried the bruschetta appetizer, which was perfect. The flavors are all excellent. The Alfaro Pinot Noir was great, too!  
                  This was a nice place for my first visit.  Small little corner spot in San Pedro square. Had a glass of wine and some appetizers. And what a great happy hour.   We had the burrata and the Brie, fig, and prosciutto crostini. Both so delicious!   Come by and check it out!  
                  My wife and I ate here tonight before going to a Sharks game.  We read the reviews on Yelp and decided to check it out. Wonderful place... Nice wine selection, great food, very nice atmosphere... And excellent service from Emma... She was very attentive and spot on with her descriptions of the wines and food options.  
                  My friend and I came here on Friday after work. We made reservations and I would recommend that you do if you want to come after work because the place is pretty busy. The service here is good too, our waitress was nice and attentive and joked around with us. My friend and I both got the flights for $15 bucks which is a pretty good deal. We got two whites and two reds in our tasting. All of them were pretty good, local wines. We also ordered apps, paninis, and dessert. For apps we got the bruschetta and baguettes and dips. Both were tasty. The bread they use tastes fresh and chewy, in a good way. For the panini I got the chicken pesto and the Italian meats. We both enjoyed them and ate everything. For the desert, per our waitresses suggestion, we got the salted caramel dessert. It was so good!!!! Delicious! I love salted caramel anything and that did not disappoint. Overall, I would give this place 4 stars.  
                  Love the San Pedro Market. Decided to try Vino Vino, and we were surprised by how much we enjoyed it, given the fact that we were both minors. Loved the panini, and the service was stellar. Sat outside, and they turned up the heat lamp and got us our food in under 10 minutes. Coming back for date night!  
                  This place has a huge wine selection and has been my hangout spot for my friends and I on  ThirstyThursdays for long while. We have been fairly regulars at this location and have always been served by Emma for the last few weeks. The service here is great and the staff is pretty knowledgeable with their recommendations.  
                  I really like Vino Vino. I went here for a &#34;happy hour&#34; with a colleague, though they don&#39;t really have any happy hour specials that I know of. I wish they did advertise, or have a happy hour menu. We ordered a bottle of wine, and some light bites and sandwiches. Everything we had was good! The cheese selection could be a little more exotic than it was, but it was still decent.  I especially liked my sandwich, which I think was the grilled cheese. My colleague got the fig sandwich, and I was pleasantly surprised by it. The portions for some of the appetizers are a little small for the price, like the bruschetta.   The wine bar itself is tiny! You probably can&#39;t fit more than a few people in a group here per table, but that lends itself to a quiet and nice night.   Overall, I think the food and wine selection is good, so I recommend going! I&#39;ll for sure be back!  
                  My girlfriend and I decided to have some wine and cheese on a Saturday night. We&#39;ve been looking at vino vino for quite some time.   When we arrived it seem pretty empty for a Saturday.  Our server was Becca. She was really sweet and was educated about the menu.   For our appetizer we went with the smoked salmon crostini. The bread was a little crunchy for me but I enjoy the smoked salmon with the basil pesto.   For the cheese and charcuterie we went with the cheese and meat plate combo. The price on that was $16 pretty reasonable. We had fra&#39; mani smoked ham &amp; prosciutto Di Parma for our meat  For our cheese we had mt ham and perfetto pecrorino.  The food was amazing and blended so well with our wine.  Speaking of wine... We had Pinot noir ( Alfaro, Santa Cruz ) and the Last weekend.  I enjoyed this place but it was a bit cold inside :(  
                  I&#39;m always chillin&#39; at San Pedro Square Market since there&#39;s so many awesome food options and foodie spots to try. Funny that it took me this long to finally stop into Vino Vino.   I had a fun girls night here with my friend Abigail recently. I went ahead and did the Wine Flight for myself and went for all the reds on tap, mostly Cabs (I forget which ones I tried specifically but they were recommended to me by our awesome server).   The thing that I would totally go back for is their Brie Fig Prosciutto Crostini which was brie, fig spread, prosciutto, fig walnut balsamic vinaigrette all on top of a perfectly crisped crostini. Ohhhh bomb-diggity-get-in-my-mouf-and-get-jiggity!   Their cheese and meat plates are pretty standard in my opinion. Nothing too wow-ing.  And another tidbit for my fellow small-bladder gals, the restroom is uber close to the seating area as this place is really small. So you can rush back and forth just fine and maybe order yourself more glasses of wine? ;)  
                  oh vino vino  The place is a little weird. It&#39;s both part of the food court area, but has it&#39;s own separate, official store entrance linked directly to the public street. It also has it&#39;s own bar and seating area, and waitress serving you. Is it a food court shop, or a bar, or a wine spot? Who knows?  In any case, the wine is great, the atmosphere and vibe is chill, the furniture comfortable, and the waitresses easy on the eyes :) The Tap Flight menu option was a pretty good deal as well, letting you taste 5 different kinds of wine at once. Not being a wine expert myself, the thing I truly appreciated about being able to taste 5 cups of wine is that, well, I get to drink 5 cups of wine :)  Definitely a go-to spot that I hope to go back again.  
                  Nice place, good wine of course! Also a nice place to enjoy watching the Warriors game! I like here, my new fav spot!  
                  Cute spot that&#39;s got an outdoor section ideal for people watching, especially when there are events at the SAP center. The wine is good, appetizers as well. Another cool thing about this spot is there are a number of other spots in the square to eat and drink - something for everyone no matter what.  
                  Came here with my homegirl and OMG! We&#39;re definitely coming back here again. The service was great! The cute waitress checked up on us a lot and was super nice. We got the tap flight wine tasting, creme brûlée, and the assorted meat/cheese platter! And we loved every single thing!!! We each drank 2 tap flights and we were wine wasted  
                  A friend and I came here on a *very* off night (important basketball game, new employee training) and were underwhelmed. A lot of things went wrong. At first they couldn&#39;t find our reservation, but then they did. Next, our order took forever, and when it came, the line cooks actually got it wrong (multiple times). The bartender was lovely, but the whole vibe was just strange.   However, there were some plusses, which is why I&#39;d consider coming back. First, the wine was very good. I tried both cabs, and they were different but excellent. I also loved the wines &#34;on tap&#34; - clever and cute. The food was fine, and some of the other orders going by looked decent. I could see how under different circumstances, this would be a very cool place to hang out.  Another strange thing. When we emerged into the rest of San Pedro square and took a walk around, I felt like I was 10 years too old. Think loud 20-somethings getting their drink on.  Parking was awful, even with the huge lot next door.  
                  San Jose is short on places to convene late at night to socialize, but Vino Vino is one of those spots that gives San Jose a bit of a night life. It&#39;s pretty small, but that only gives it an intimate atmosphere that I enjoy. There&#39;s a wide selection of wines sold by the glass or the bottle. There&#39;s also food that pairs well with wine.  Overall a pretty straightforward wine bar that provides a great place to chill and have a conversation among friends. I&#39;m a fan.  
                  Started with the Brie and prosciutto crostini . It literally melted in my mouth . Wanted to eat light so had I followed with the ahi tuna salad . It was very light and fresh , exactly what I was looking for . I will be back without a doubt .  
                  Came for happy hour which has amazing prices, $5 apps and $7 on tap wine.  Orders the burrata (kinda bland, with just olive oil, but the cheese was still great), gig and prosciutto crostini was AMAZING! Great choice for happy hour in my book.  
                  This place is super cute! It&#39;s tucked into the corner of San Pedro square. I love the wooden furniture and decor. It&#39;s a wine bar so they have wine on tap which is super cool! I ended up going against the grain and getting a stout instead of a glass of beer and it was really good! I also split the grilled truffle cheese sandwich. It was bomb! Despite having split the sandwich it was quite filling! And it comes with a little side salad as well which was really nice and fresh and light. Overall I would definitely recommend trying out this place especially if you&#39;re in the mood for some good wine and cheese pairings!  
                  I came to Vino Vino for my birthday and I absolutely loved the place. The wine flights were great. The cheese plate was amazing and our sever was awesome. Can&#39;t wait to come back  
                  This place is awesome! It&#39;s connected to San Pedro square on the right side. Very tiny place. They&#39;ve got wonderful appetizers and tons of different wines. It&#39;s so much more worth it to order whole bottles of wine. That&#39;s how my boyfriend and I ended up with a bottle of Riesling ($26) for the two of us. I love Riesling and I thought theirs was good but not great. It wasn&#39;t as smooth as other ones I&#39;ve had. It was the only one they had though so it&#39;s definitely not bad. Ended up getting the meat and cheese platter ($16) with the cheddar cheese, and the Mt Tam which is similar to Brie cheese but in my opinion it&#39;s softer, the spicy salami and prosciutto. All were delicious with the tag cheese and spicy salami being my favorites. The platter also came with honey, fig jam, grapes, apple slices and bread.  Fig jam with the tam cheese was just heavenly! The bf and I devoured this entire platter and half the bottle of wine in less than 25 mins since it was so good. We ended up ordering yet ANOTHER additional cheese platter ($14).. gosh the waitress must have thought we were major fatties. I was so full of cheese, bread and wine by the end of the night. Wayyy too full. Prices are a bit steep but they use really good quality meat and cheeses so it was well worth the cost. I&#39;ll definitely be back!  Service was also excellent even though it was super packed! One little lady running around but she did a great job!  
                  A nice place to go if you are looking for small plates and wine. Tight seating but there are seats inside and out.   Our waitress was super nice. The overall staff seemed to be nice and friendly. We ordered the smoked salmon crostini ($7 for 6-5 pieces), 2 meat and cheese plates ($16 per), and a bottle of wine ($29).  I really enjoyed everything we ate that night. Would recommend and come back again.  
                  I love this place! It&#39;s a convenient little stop that really lives up to the &#34;wine without attitude&#34; catch phrase. I&#39;ve been here with friends, family, and on a couple of dates, and the setting fits all 3. It&#39;s a casual, laid-back atmosphere, with helpful, friendly staff. I&#39;ve ordered the salmon crostini (excellent), a couple of the salads (also great), and a variety of wines. Other people I&#39;ve been with have tried the paninis, as well as the beer, and I&#39;ve heard nothing but positive feedback. Any day of the week, during a game or just the middle of the afternoon, I&#39;d recommend this place to everyone.  
                  Love their meat &amp; cheeseboardt. Comes with fresh fruits (grapes &amp; apples), 2 meats &amp; 2 cheeses of your choice, honey, and last time I think ours came with pepper jam ($16) Come during happy hour for a cheaper deal. I love that they offer mt. tam cheese from cow girl creamery. Their panini&#39;s (~$9) are also really good. My favorite is the fig, brie &amp; prosciutto panini on fresh Acme bread. Panini&#39;s also come with a basic side salad. The smoked salmon crostini and fig, brie, prosciutto are also pretty good.   Wine- if you&#39;re with friends, grab a bottle of wine to go and find a table in the market to sit &amp; enjoy since it&#39;s $10 off.   If you&#39;re a wine, meat &amp; cheese kinda gal like me, this is your spot.  
                  Vino vino is a perfect place to get your wine fix downtown San Jose. It is located in the San Pedro market which is perfect for wine and dining!   The best part about vino vino is wine tasting for a good price! You can have 4 flights of your own choice for only 15$. Most of the glasses are about 8$ and the bottles to take home are 30$ and up.   They also have a nice little menu that complements the wines well such as cheese platter, panini, salad, and appetizers.   The service is good and the owner is very down to earth, I will be back!   Overall, I like that vino vino has good price wine tasting, has a downtown vibe, the service is fast, and you can pair some food with your wine selection.  
                  The wine selection by the glass is much to be desired for a wine bar. The charcuterie platter was decent but the portions are tiny. The atmosphere is ok and small, with large screens showing football.  The service was great.  
                  My new favorite spot for happy hour with my beloved coworkers. I believe they have happy hour specials from 2pm-6pm during the week.   Let&#39;s start off with the fact that you can get their Tap Flight (4 choices of 2 ounces of their wines on tap) for $15! Any wine lovers dream. Suggestion: Get the GSM and Alpha Red -- they are the bomb.   Brie Fig Proscuitto Crostini and Smoked Salmon Crostini are delicious appetizers. Their cheese &amp; charcuterie choices are pretty good too, not to mention that their artisan bread it is served with is sooooo tasty. I could just eat the bread by itself and still be a happy gal.   They have a cute outdoor area with heaters to keep you nice and toasty even on a chilly evening.  
                  Happy Hour is from 2-6. $5 appetizers and $12 for a meat and cheese plate!  The staff is pretty helpful here. I came in to look at the menu and was dumbfounded at the names of cheeses. Before I came here, I was only familiar with the colloquial Pepper Jack, Cheddar, Mozzarella, Provolone, etc. The staff was kind enough to explain what kind of cheeses would suit my palate after I told them I like hard cheeses over soft cheeses.  Vino Vino is attached to San Pedro Square in downtown San Jose and also has its own sign on the outside.   I would highly recommend coming here during happy hour. I&#39;m not a wine or alcohol person, but for those of you who are, a glass of wine is $7. Pair this with the meat and cheese plate, and you&#39;ve got yourself a  heaven-on-earth experience in your mouth (or so I&#39;m told).  But for me, the meat and cheese plate suffices completely on its own, with its tasty cheeses, meats, and fruits. It&#39;s easily shareable, and the taste of the meat and cheeses are really fine and delectable.  Definitely coming back!  
                  If you are a wine lover, this is a place you&#39;ve gotta try out!  Located on the outer edge of San Pedro Market Square, Vino Vino is a small wine bar and restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating. Just sit where ever you want and a friendly waitress will bring over a menu.   Obviously, they have quite a few wines to choose from. If you can&#39;t decide, try their flight sample of wines on tap. It&#39;s 4 glasses, 2oz each, 2 whites and 2 reds! The waitress was very knowledgeable about every kind of wine and gladly helped us out with our choices without making us feel like idiots (which is a nice change when it comes to wine!). They&#39;ve got some appetizers, cheese and meat plates, salads, and paninis to pair with your wines. We opted for the simple cheese dish, pick 4 different kinds! Our waitress was kind enough to help with those too. Both recommendations were awesome!  This place excelled in all areas of service, booze, and food. I will definitely come back here again!  
                  Came here for a lady date with a friend.  The patio was a nice place to have a casual lunch on a pretty day.    We shared a carafe of chardonnay (the Hollister one), which was very light.  Loved it.  We also has a cheese plate.  The cheeses were good, but the selection is rather small.  The crostinis are awesome.  The spreads were okay.  I&#39;m a mustard girl, so I really missed not having that or some kind of tapenade, but the sweet pepper spread was okay.  We also shared a caprese prociutto panini, which was AMAZING.  Seriously really good.  And the little side salad that came with it was tasty, too.    Service was good.  Our waiters (shift change) were both friendly and professional, our orders were perfect, and we had no complaints.  Prices were comparable for the food and the area.    If they added a couple cheeses to their selection (maybe a goat cheese or two), and elevated the spreads they serve with the cheese platter, I&#39;d give five stars.  
                  I came here on a non-happy hour time which wasn&#39;t great for my wallet but in either case, the food and wine is always good here :)  Had the salmon crustini, edadame, and a soft cheese(?) dish, all of which were good. But out of them all I think the edadame is my favorite...just something about that slight spiciness and truffle oil... mmmmmm. With all the food I had the $15 wine flight I usually have that has never disappointed me so yay~  the one minus star is for the slow service they have here. My friend and I were one of the 2 parties at the time we got there and it still took a heck of a long time to get our order and get our food. But meh - maybe it was an off day. I&#39;ll still be back :)  
                  Two thumbs up for supporting local wineries, but Vino Vino seats on 3 to 4 star borderline.  Decided to have a girls night here, because we were in need of some good wine and yummy cheeses. I also told them I heard about how Vino Vino had wine on tap, which definitely won them over.  We each got tap flights (4 glasses of 2 oz pours), here&#39;s what I got:  Savignon Blanc, Martella from Monterey White Blend, N2 from Sonoma Bobcat Red, Santa Cruz Mountain Vineyard from Santa Cruz Cabernet, Bella Montagna from San Francisco Bay  For food we shared the Cheese &amp; Meat Plate: with the Humboldt Fog, Wookey Cheddar, Hot Sopressata and Felcineo Mortadella with pistachio. All the plates come with Honey, fruit tapenade (sweet onion), bread, fresh fruit (apple &amp; grapes) and bread of course.  Additionally to that we ordered the Baguette &amp; Dip which were slices of bread, pesto and sun-dried peppers with basil in olive oil. Smoked Salmon Crostini which had smoked salmon, creme fraiche and pesto. Lastly the Brie, Prosciutto di Parma and Fig Jam Crostini. For dessert we got the Salted Caramel Pot de Creme, tastes like a creme brulee without the sugar coating and comes with yummy Biscoff type biscuits.  My favorites from the taps were the Savignon Blanc, White Blend and Cab. The white had lovely fruity notes with peach and apple flavors. The blend is very light, soft and refreshing. As for the cheese and meat plate, I felt like it was lacking a bit, not that many slices of Mortadella, a couple of grapes and we did have to get our bread bowl refilled about 3 times. The appetizers were okay, the Fig and Prosciutto Crostini was probably the best out of the three. The smoked salmon didn&#39;t have much of a smokey flavor.  Service is unusually casual, the server helping us didn&#39;t really recommend anything in particular and said everything pairs nicely with one another. Also she asked us if she could use her phone to take our orders down, I suppose if that helps? Price is decent, but nothing really amazing with their selection of cheeses or appetizers here.  
                  This was my last stop before leaving San Jose. I got a wine flight from the choices on tap, and all of them were delicious. For food I got a caprese salad and the brie fig prosciutto sandwich, the latter of which most of us ordered and adored. We sat outside because the weather was gorgeous (so glad it was slow so they could fit five of us outside!) and our service was friendly. We had a nice time! I would go back for different wines on tap or to get that sandwich to go.  
                  Awesome place for a wine bar! It&#39;s connected to the San Pedro Square Market, but also a place of it&#39;s own at the same time. Great area to find seating if you want a place that&#39;s a bit quieter than inside SPSM. I know it can get a little hectic over there and sometimes it&#39;s hard to find a seat. They also have a giant TV screen that plays the Sharks game during game days. True fans! lol  They got a few wines on tap. I recommend getting their wine flights. You get to pick 4 of any wine (red or white) on tap. It&#39;s $15 for 2 oz. each cup, which I find more than enough.  Favorites: - Whites: Pinot Gris and White Blend - Reds: GSM  Cheese plate is highly recommended! You can pick up to 4 cheeses. It comes with seasonal jam, fresh fruit, and honey with unlimited bread. I love how they panini their bread so it&#39;s all warm and toasty! Favorites: - Mt. Tam - Wookey Cheddar  Great place to chill and sip on wine! #pinkiesup  
                  Vino Vino is a great place to hang out and grab a drink before the Sharks game or even dinner in San Pedro Sq. The ambiance is nice with tall tables and bar stools.   There&#39;s also a happy hour in which you can choose sampler items to pair up with your wine. While the food is pretty pricey, I suggest sticking to the happy hour wine and then getting food elsewhere.   There&#39;s also outlets near the tables so you can work / plug in your phone while you have a glass of wine - perfect!  
                  Great place for glasses of wine, great small plates ad cozy conversation.  Highly recommend the burrata and the cheese plate!  
                  This is my first time to come here . Nice local wine selection. Out seating is vey nice. I would recommend to everyone who like wine!  
                  I ordered the fig, brie, &amp; prosciutto panini and omg it was freaking amazeballs. All the flavors combined together with such grace and perfection: the sweet fig jam and the savory prosciutto together with the tangy balsamic and brie to balance it all out - I can&#39;t even begin to describe how delicious it all was. Probably the best sandwich I&#39;ve ever had in my life.  They have a special offer on their website for a free appetizer if you&#39;re a new customer. You just have to enter in your phone number and they&#39;ll text you the offer. We decided on the smoked salmon crostini and that was very tasty as well.  Trendy and cozy ambiance. Not the biggest space but there&#39;s indoor and outdoor seating available. The high tables inside have little hooks on the side to hold your bag so you don&#39;t have to keep it on your lap the whole time! :D  Definitely a place I would come back to/bring friends. Highly recommend!  
                  I came here for a lunch date Saturday afternoon. We arrived around 12:15pm and had our choice at tables - there was one other couple there.   Vino Vino is very quaint and rustic. Perfect place for a date. They also have a cute nook area and can push tables together for larger groups.   We ordered a tap flight and a carafe of wine. Unfortunately, none of them were that memorable, but I was quiet inebriated by the end of the date.   Food: Cheese &amp; Meat Plate: Pick 2 cheeses and 2 meats Brie - Brie is one of my least favorite type of cheese as brie isn&#39;t very flavorful to me, so this wasn&#39;t too memorable. Humbolt Fog - Goat&#39;s Milk Cheese, very tasty!  Hot Sopressata - Not hot enough for me, but I enjoyed this.  Prosciutto di Parma - This doesn&#39;t stick out in my mind.   Brie Fig Prosciutto Panini -  This was divine mostly due to the fig walnut balsamic vinaigrette that got everywhere! I love the combination of sweet and savory so this was a great choice.  Chicken Pesto - Tasty. Chicken was cooked perfectly and the pesto was deliciously garlicy!   I had a great time and would like to go back and try their other wines that aren&#39;t on tap.  
                  Happy Hour (HH) in SF can be ridonkulous.   Elbowing your way through hoards of techies to order a drink, paying $14 for a frou frou cocktail, and buzzingly gazing into the eyes of... the hobo outside waving at you. Thank you, Twitter hyper-gentrification.   While this may be only true in the area that I work in, the rest of SF&#39;s HH can be quite ridonkulous. Try getting a table at Palomino&#39;s or Waterbar during HH and you&#39;ll know what I&#39;m talking about. Sure there are less crowded places but the only eye candy will be beautiful rustic red brick wall that doesn&#39;t respond to you.   I&#39;m not sure how the SJ HH culture is but from what I gather after going to Vino Vino for HH, me likey.   There was plenty of street parking when we arrived and when we left hours later. I love that a quarter gets you 15 minutes; we get 3 minutes in SF. There&#39;s also free validated parking for the lot across the street. You can also make reservations for HH which is unheard of. We came on a Wednesday at 3 pm so reservations weren&#39;t necessary.   Vino Vino has a HH Menu available Monday - Friday from 2 pm - 6 pm: *$5 Appetizers (save up to $2) *$12 Cheese &amp; Charcuterie Plate (save $4) *$1 off all beers (all are $4-$5) *$7 per a glass of all wines on tap (save $1) or $20 per a carafe (save $5)  Other than the HH menu, all their local wines are reasonably priced with the most expensive bottle at $45. If you order a bottle to go, it&#39;s $10 off which is awesome if you need a last minute gift.   We both had several glasses of the Sauvignon Blanc ($7) and Pinot Gris ($7) on tap which was alright. Even though I&#39;m still a wine noob, I prefer imported wines (which they don&#39;t offer) over local wines.  Seeing so many people rave about the Smoked Salmon Crostini (HH - $5), we had to get an order of that and the Cheese &amp; Charcuterie Plate (HH - $12) for good measure.   The Smoked Salmon Crostini was good but not spectacular. You can never go wrong with lox and cheese so it was hard to screw up this app:  bit.ly/1gE6ts9 .    For the Cheese &amp; Charcuterie Plate, we went with the Mt. Tam, Humboldt Fog, Prosciutto di Parma and Finocchiona Salame which were served with Acme toast points, apples, grapes, mustard, and honey:  bit.ly/1ghfd6z . A solid collection of deliciously creamy cheeses and salty sheets of swine so fine. My fav was the Mt. Tams from Cowgirl Creamery which is like a triple cream brie and the Prosciutto di Parma with a nice line of marbling.   Service was very pleasant and our waitress was very friendly and attentive. She even offered to toast up some more bread for us when she saw we had several lingering sheets of swine so fine left.   The ambiance reminded me of a wine cellar with lots of woods and a rustic red brick wall. Most of the seating is communal seating and counter seats. The outdoor patio is perfect for those summer days so you can wine and stare at all the passersby. There&#39;s also several flat screen TVs to catch the game on.   Luckily, I didn&#39;t have to resort to talking to that rustic red brick wall and looking all cray cray since I had eye candy sitting across from me. ( ^ _~ )  
                  Good quality food, but lacks imagination.  With so many other places to try, I would not go there again.  PROS: Extensive local wine list. Parking in the garage across the street.  CONS: Dead on the weekends. You could find the menu items at any wine bar; there really are no unique items.  
                  Got a bottle of wine to-go here which was really good and just ended up walking around the rest of San Pedro Market. After a couple more trips here maybe I&#39;ll be able to raise my review to 5 stars.  
                  Vino Vino is a cute spot that will almost make you forget that you&#39;re in Downtown San Jose, then the hobos meander by and stare lovingly at your appetizers and maybe your body parts if you&#39;re unlucky. We started with bruschetta and smoked salmon crostini, which were a bit too small for my taste, but then again I was lusting after carbs after a prolonged separation. We accompanied these with a 500 ml carafe of pinot noir, which ran us $26, yes you can get a better deal elsewhere but you&#39;re paying to sit under reclaimed wood and exposed  light bulbs--that hipster lifestyle will run you some change, dude. We quickly followed those with two more carafes of chardonnay, which our server helped us pick. He was pretty helpful choosing wines, but even more helpful in not judging us when catching bits and pieces of our conversation about our embarrassing drunken escapades. We also indulged in the truffle grilled cheese, YAAAS MA&#39;AM.  
                  We came here on a very busy Saturday night and was able to get seating for 3 right away. This wine bar is located in the prime real estate restaurant row of San Pedro Market Square, with a parking lot right next to it. Convenient.   We stated with a bottle of red. The wine selection was fantastic. A lot of local wine, both red and white. I normally enjoy white wine but I felt in the mood for red since it was chilly out. I loved that they have a lot of wine on tap for casual tasters.  After we selected our wine of choice, I ordered the smoked salmon crostini an appetizer. It was the best! It&#39;s something about smoked salmon and cream cheese that i love so much. They made it perfectly and it tasted really buttery and savory. Everything you&#39;d want in a crostini!  We ordered two kinds of panini&#39;s: the Brie one (#1) and the grilled truffle cheese one. The Brie was really delightful with its sweet mild flavor. It tasted almost like it could be a dessert. The grilled truffle cheese was prepared perfectly. The truffle oil was not overbearing, and it had the right balance. It was a very aromatic, savory panini and something I would order over and over again. The panini&#39;s were not actually pressed too much and the fillings kept falling out. Not a big deal but I know some people can be particular about that.  Obviously we could not end our meal without some some dessert. We had the chocolate truffle cake and the salted caramel pot de creme. The chocolate truffle cake had such an intense flavor that was so true to its name. Gorgeous, dark and creamy - it was such an indulgent treat. However, the real winner of the night was the salted caramel pot de creme. It was this custard-like texture in a creme brûlée cup. It tasted like actual salted caramel with just a hint of sea salt, and not overbearing like many places. Incredible texture, really tasty and what a fun note to end on.  
                  I held a corporate event here for my company. I thought it was very professionally handled. We also had special requirements, and the owners went out of the way to help.  
                  Really good appetizers and wine. Especially the Mann Reisling. It&#39;s most cost effective to get the whole bottle rather than buying individual glasses if you&#39;re in a party of 2 or more.  
                  My friend and I just got back from this place.  We had a lot of fun.  I really liked the wine tap thing that they have going on, especially since they put a lot of energy into showcasing local wines.  We shared a cheese plate, which came with some honey and some mustard.  I just wish they had a larger variety of hard cheeses to sample (they only had one cheddar), as soft cheeses are new to me and I consider that to be an acquired taste that I haven&#39;t really yet acquired.  Service was great, they had the Sharks game on (we won, woot!), and we had a fun time.  Revisits will be mandatory.  
                  I love Vino Vino! I&#39;ve been here multiple times, and have enjoyed the wine &amp; food. Happy hour prices could be better [and prices are kind of expensive to begin with], but you&#39;re in down town San Jose, so I mean... can&#39;t be too picky. Although I think the beer is really reasonably priced. $7 for a glass of wine for happy hour though?! Kind of expensive. The carafe is a better deal, but I mean... I&#39;m not going to try to drink a whole carafe myself! Meat &amp; cheese platter is on point, and I&#39;ve loved every panini I&#39;ve tried. My bestie really liked their creme brulee as well.  All in all, a great place to meet up &amp; chat with friends you&#39;ve not seen in awhile [or maybe friends you see every day... up to you!]. Servers are friendly &amp; atmosphere is kind of busy, but pretty quiet. If that makes sense.  
                  I love love love this place! I usually get the ahi salad and the salmon crostini (Hope I got that right - it&#39;s in the appetizer section), pair it with a little vino and viola! But last night I got a ham and brie sandwich - AMAZING! I really liked that I was able to sit and gab with a friend here. Really small and quaint, but I dig it!  
                  This is one of my favorite lunch spots in all of Downtown San Jose. It is just a small wine eatery that is nestled in San Pedro Square (also one of my favorite places to hangout in all of San Jose). They have great sandwiches, great service, and amazing wine.  I have tried several different sandwiches on the numerous times I&#39;ve been here. Some of my favorites are the Brie Fig Prosciutto, which is a great salty, creamy, and sweet sandwich, and the Smoked Salmon sandwich with the crusty baguette, tasty salmon, and delicious basil pesto aioli. Definitely do not skip on the sandwich. They are to die for.  They have some great wines on tap, mostly red, but some good white wines as well. This place is the best when you round up a few of your wine friends, order a bottle, and just relax the night away.  
                  Pretty awesome place to go and hangout with a small group of friends. The wine is limited selection but nonetheless still good.   Our server was nice, friendly and helpful which is a plus. The atmosphere is also pretty welcoming and not to hectic, but maybe that was because it was 11:30pm.  
                  I&#39;m a level 2 sommelier and I have to say the wine selection is wonderful. It&#39;s got presence without that crazy overbearing sophistication that can really over sell a wine. Worth the money but every great wine bar need foie gras! The only thing I wanted to grace the menu that didn&#39;t. In case you&#39;d like a great recipe just hit me up and I&#39;ll prove it could be an amazing addition to this menu!  
                  Vino Vino is pretty easy to miss if you&#39;re hanging out in the San Pedro area. I probably wouldn&#39;t have checked it out had I not seen good reviews on Yelp.  Although I think their food options are limited, I thought my order was pretty tasty and they have a pretty impressive wine selection.  Got the baguette with dip &amp; smoked salmon crostini for appetizers. The smoked salmon was delicious but I&#39;m pretty biased towards anything seafood :) The baguette and dip was OK--pretty average and I&#39;d recommend trying their other appetizers instead.  Had the ahi tuna salad which was YUMMY! I love sashimi and appreciated the fact that their ahi tuna was sashimi instead of the usual seared variety. The wasabi aoli was delicious and complemented the tuna perfectly. Portion size was just right and didn&#39;t give me a food coma plus I had just enough room to split dessert afterwards.  Our group of 4 ended up splitting a truffle cake and creme brulee. The truffle cake was rich but not too overpowering. I&#39;m not usually a fan of chocolate cakes because I find them too sweet but their truffle cake had the bittersweet taste of dark chocolate which balanced the thick, fudge like consistency of the cake.  The creme brulee was delicious. My favorite part about creme brulee? Doing the honor of cracking that perfectly torched caramel glaze on top and scooping that first spoonful of yummy custardy goodness. I would&#39;ve liked for the custard to be slightly on the thicker side as theirs was a little too runny for my taste but it was good nonetheless.   I&#39;d say our dessert choices were perfectly balanced and the two really complemented each other :) Great way to end our meal!  
                  Decent enough food and wine, good place for a late night gathering with some friends. I would probably rate Vino Vino 3.5 stars if I could. I tried a couple samples of their wine here last weekend and while some of them were pretty good, I found the variety to be lacking somewhat. The food on other hand was delicious! I ordered an appetiser of smoke prosciutto, bre cheese, and freshly baked French bread, suffice to say it was gone pretty quick. Our waitress was very kind and she seemed to know a good amount about wine; she helped us decide which one would suit us best. It&#39;s an okay restaurant if your in the area, I&#39;ll leave it at that.  
                  Came here mid day for a meeting. Cute little spot with a nice selection of wine a desserts. Affordable as well. If I&#39;m in the area, it&#39;s nice to stop by, plenty of options in the general area as well.  
                  A nice, laid-back local wine bar with decent food and average prices. It holds value by its atmosphere, nearby location to DTSJ&#39;s loud bar scene, and a humble feeling, which is proudly displayed on their store, &#34;wine without attitude&#34;.  
                  5/5: The Tiramisu is excellent:  yelp.com/biz_photos/vino…  Great espresso flavor, and nice creamy mousse texture.  One of the best I&#39;ve had.  4.5/5: The chocolate truffle cake is very good:  yelp.com/biz_photos/vino…  $8.  The interior has great texture; just like a dense truffle, and it has a crispy bottom layer.  If the chocolate were darker, and if it had maybe another layer of crispy hazelnut, it would be as good as the Royal at Fleur de Cocoa.  2/5: But the much-raved about brie, fig, and prosciutto panini was skippable:   yelp.com/biz_photos/vino…  $8.50.  Nothing special about it at all, and a small size.  I got the Bobcat Red wine (on tap), from Santa Cruz Mountain Vinyard ($8.50); I don&#39;t recommend it; it&#39;s about as good as an $8 bottle of wine from Trader Joe&#39;s.  
                  So I&#39;ve been contacted by the co owner of Vino Vino personally to apologize for my previous experience here. He even offered to make my experience better by coming back and experiencing the wine with a more experienced bartender.   I feel as though this shows huge professionalism and shows that the management cares a lot about their customers and what they have to say. This really impressed me and I&#39;ll give them an extra star for service and professionalism.   I retract that I will not come back, I will definitely try to give this place another chance.  
                  Vino Vino is located in downtown San Jose right next to an oodle of bars, and is technically located WITHIN the San Jose market place. It has a large assortment of wines on tap (pretty cool tap, as well!)   Service and food both get 4 stars. The server was very pleasant, but I think she was the only one working so it was a little slow. Our group all got paninis which apparently were all delicious. A couple of people got the italian meat and cheese panini and loved it, I got the chicken pesto panini and it was absolutely delicious. I don&#39;t usually like paninis because they&#39;re sometimes over heated and very hard, but this one was perfect. I didn&#39;t care for the vinagrette dressing on the salad that came with the paninis. Wine flights were $15 for 4 different samples, otherwise I thought the wine was a little pricey at $8-$11 per glass. Guess that&#39;s just Cali for ya.   Otherwise, this is a cute little place that warrants another visit if I end up in downtown San Jose again!  
                  In the heart of downtown and in San Carlos square, this place is small but on point. Swung by for a little day drinking and lunch action, had the flight wine tasters (4 wine samples) and chicken pannini. Sat outside to enjoy the beautiful weather and good music ambience, we will be back!  
                  Solid 4 stars.  The decor is awesome, the place is lively, the servers are nice. Great date place.  Wine selection is good (as you&#39;d expect from a place with a name like this), but surprisingly few wines by the glass for a winebar. Their beer list was fairly good too - good variety (e.g. you can get a stout or a hefe or a double IPA).  Menu is good but food isn&#39;t perfect.   Crostinis - 4 star - Good crostini selection (e.g. prosciutto/fig, pecorni/something) but slightly unbalanced (the balsamic, while delicious, overpowered everything else), and funny enough the bready was a bit too hard and crusty to eat comfortably.  Cheese and charcuterie selections - 5 star -Not huge but good, interesting selection. Thank you for not being boring :)  Dessert - 4 stars - Super tasty tiramisu. Salted caramel pot de creme had way too much salt on top (though the creme was great).  Overall, solid place, will come again. The ingredients are there - if they spent a little more time balancing their food and making it a bit more refined, this would be 5 stars.  
                  Quaint little spot. I love the rustic tables and the overall vibe of the place.  Angel had the tiramisu which was deliciously decadent by her accounts. Lora and I each had a flight of reds ($14 for four 2 ounce tastings). They&#39;re heavy handed with their pours from what I could tell... Which can&#39;t be anything but awesome, amirite? Also, we stayed almost &#39;til closing and never felt rushed or hurried to leave.  I&#39;ll definitely be back to try some tasty bites or for another GNO. Me likey.  
                  Such a nice little restaurant! The waitress, while abrupt, was very knowledgeable about wine and the menu. We ordered a test flight of red wines, with comes with 2o, which were good sized portions. Their cheese plates are also quite generous. 4 cheeses for $14. The tables are all fairly close to each other, so intimate would be the right word. They have quite a limited seating area though, but thats what comes with San Pedro Square. It is the outskirts, but still the square.  The pannini&#39;s s were good, the wine was good, ambience was quaint and good, and the salted carmel pudding was better than good. All around, excellent experience. The only reason for knocking off a star was the waitress was less than friendly. Would certainly go again though :)  
                  Came here for my birthday with about seven people. The seating area is small so we needed to push tables together. Thankfully I came early (around 6pm on a Friday) in order to snag the number of tables we needed. Service was okay--kind of slow--even though the place is so small. The wine on tap was good. We did a wine tasting and liked 3 out of 5 of them.  
                  On my second visit to vino vino I&#39;m not disappointed. Good wine on tap. Really good food. Nothing to filling... I&#39;d suggest the food maybe for lunch but not if your extremely hungry. Waitress was very nice   My only suggestion and why it&#39;s not 5 out of 5 for me is what is up with the music in this place. Nice food, nice decor, but the most mixed random weird music. Country annoying pop. I&#39;m confused lol. Figure out some music... And this place is 5 out of 5.  
                  Nice lil jaunt to go have a bottle of wine and some small plates or a salad.  Patio seating is a plus.  Staff is on point with customer service!  
                  I&#39;ve enjoyed Vino Vino several times, and an outstanding establishment like this deserves a review.  Consistently I have been pleased with each and every experience while dinning here, which statistically must be significant or I should play the lottery.  Tonight, I had the chicken pesto panini with melted provolone, fresh tomatoes, pesto aioli on a herb ciabatta roll with mixed greens on the side.  I&#39;ve tasted most of their panini&#39;s and they are all perfectly prepared; warm and soft on the inside with a crunchy exterior. The food is attractively presented as well.  The wines are as fresh as can be, as they are in barrels purged with nitrogen.  They only serve wines, white and red, from local select wineries.  I had a glass of the N2 Sonoma Blend white, which was perfect for my palate, as it was on the sweet side and not too dry.    The staff and service compliment the food and wine like a perfect wine pairing.  This place is exemplary of what a wine bar should be!  
                  The place to go where wine is on tap and beer is in bottles. They serve local  California wines and you can also get a wine tap flight. Near San Pedro Square. There&#39;s both indoor and outdoor seating. It&#39;s cozy, in realtor terms. The bartender was pleasant and helpful, even giving us a sample of a wine we weren&#39;t sure we wanted to order.  It&#39;s part of the Public Market area on San Pedro Square. Conveniently there is a parking garage across the street and parking self validation inside the Public Market area.  We were just chilling and passing time waiting for our child&#39;s meet &amp; greet session to end for a group he is traveling with and getting to know for the very first time. Anyway, we got to talk like adults and drink like adults. We didn&#39;t have any food, though we were tempted, but then again it was 4 pm and it was only 2 hours to dinner. Upon Yelp check-in I got a coupon for a free 2nd panini at lunch.  It&#39;s very clean and casual, with lots of bar seats inside and outside for people watching. It was very interesting to see groups of color-coordinated people out on some sort of scavenger hunt. Looked fun.  It also seems to be a wine store because they&#39;ll let you buy a bottle to go ($10 off from the drink it in the bar price).  
                  I&#39;ve always seen their sign going into the San Pedro Market Square, but never checked this place out. Good thing I did because it was absolutely delicious. This place is pretty small and tables are really close together. I didn&#39;t  mind though. Self seating, but there&#39;s table service.   I ordered the tap wine flight which consisted of 4 different wines (your choosing), but I asked my server to surprise me. It was a good selection. Also got the meat and cheese plate and ate everything on there. That onion jam, soooooooo good. I want a whole jar of it. We shared a chicken pesto panini and it came with a salad. Full of flavor but next time I want to try the truffled grilled cheese. It sounds amazing.  For dessert we got the tiramisu and the creme brulee. I loved them both and my friend loved them as well... and he doesn&#39;t even like sweets.  Coming back again soon!  
                  I love wine and I love sweets. What better place to be?  Classy but casual, this place is a wonderful stop at the end of your night. Janet O took me here to introduce me to the glorious Vino Vino. We had already stuffed ourselves with curry fries and chili-lime wings, so no savories this time. But I will definitely be back to sample some tasty food, especially the highly recommended Panini.  WINE, but of course... ------------------------------ Several wines are available on tap (4 white, 9 red) and many, many more by the bottle (7 white, 35 red).  I went with the **Cabernet Sauvignon** on tap, as I just wanted one glass before driving home. We didn&#39;t need to be drunk to enjoy the rest of our hot date! I thoroughly enjoyed my Cab -- it was bold with just the right amount of fruity flavor. On my next visit I will try the Tap Flight, which includes 2 ounces of any 4 wines on tap for $14.  DESSERT: --------------- We &#34;shared&#34; the **Chocolate Truffle Cake**, which translates to me eating nearly the entire thing. I&#39;m pretty sure J was trying to seduce me when she suggested this dessert, because it was one of the most divine chocolate desserts I&#39;ve ever had. Now that&#39;s saying something, because for damn sure I&#39;ve had maaaaany a chocolate dessert. Each bite was silky smooth with a tiny bit of crispy texture from the buttery cocoa crust on top. ( yelp.com/biz_photos/vino… )     $8 Glass of Cab + $7 Chocolate Truffle Cake ______________________   $15 Pure Happiness  I&#39;d say that&#39;s a pretty good deal. ( yelp.com/biz_photos/vino… )  SERVICE: -------------- Excellent, attentive, friendly. J and I were enjoying ourselves so much we ended up being the last customers still there at closing time. Instead of kicking us out, the waiter/bartender chatted with us while he cleaned. The great customer service is yet another testament to Vino Vino&#39;s awesomeness.  DATE TIP: Yes! This is an extremely chill date spot. Not too stuffy, and just casual enough to sit back and have a conversation. Plus there are TV&#39;s, so you can always defer to football, basketball, or hockey if things get too awkward. ;)  
                  Nice little spot in San Jose! The waiter was able to recommend a bottle and give my party of three a sample before opening it. Loved relaxing under the shade outside. If you&#39;re looking for a casual spot- this will do :)  
                  Good atmosphere and great location to have fine wines, but only downside is that they do not serve in wine glasses instead normal drinking cups. Wine without the wine glasses...hmmmm  
                  Small food &amp; wine bar on the outer edge of San Pedro Market Square with indoor and outdoor seating. Interesting, unique, and flavorful wines on tap by flights or by the glass, with wine glasses all at the same price. Don&#39;t be turned off by the idea of tap wines! They were ALL surprisingly good during our flight tastings. They also feature over 30 wines in the bottle from local Santa Cruz Mountain and Santa Clara Valley Wineries, along with half a dozen local beers. My friend &amp; I enjoyed a delicious and plentiful Cheese Plate as a starter (great assortment of cheeses, try the Perfetto Pecorino!). My Smoked Salmon panini with side salad was very good and the blue cheese &amp; walnut dinner salad got great reviews from my friend. Excellent service, fun, inviting, casual &amp; communal atmosphere. Highly recommend -- especially nice place to stop before a concert at the SAP center.  
                  If I am going to rate vino just for their wine, I would give it a 3 but overall experience, I would see why others would give it a 4 or 5 and so would I too.  I came here with Els and Vi on a Friday night. This is a perfect place to chat with your girlfriends while enjoying a glass or a flight of wine. I didn&#39;t get the chance to try their food because we dined somewhere else but Els, had their dessert, she said it was good but she will have to review that herself.   I love the interior of this place, it has that industrial touch. Hopefully next time, I&#39;ll be able try their food.  
                  I had been eating my way through the day when dinner time came. Now I&#39;m not one to just eat because but I had to work that evening and we were meeting a friend at San Pedro market square so what am I gonna do? Look for tapas.  Well, vino vino offered small bites with a cozy rustic seating area. Outside and inside.  We sat, it was happy hour, even better.  We ordered a meat and cheese plate. I just needed something to nosh on. Had a glass of yummy Pinot in an unpretentious glass and was very pleased.  My friend ordered a panini. He liked it, came with a mixed greens side salad. All seemed well enough Our waitress. She was good. The cheese we got on the plate looked like a overly small serving, she noticed it and brought us a larger portion. She also noticed that we waited longer for our panini than was right. She discounted it. She filled our water faithfully and was just plain pleasant.  So they get the 4th star based on her. I&#39;ll be back because I enjoyed the ambiance and she rounded it out.  
                  Finally got to try this place after seeing other yelpers rave about it. It was sort of hard to find; my friends and I walked around the San Pedro market square a couple of times. Follow the bathroom sign. I loved the set up; it was like a rustic hidden gem. I had the San Francisco Cabernet and the burrata during happy hour. They were both pretty good. My friend was very disappointed in the portion size for her bruschetta. The deals for happy hour weren&#39;t amazing, a dollar off most things essentially.  Our waitress was helpful, but seemed like she wanted us to leave quickly. It wasn&#39;t busy.  I think I had too high of expectations for this place. :&#34;(  
                  My friend Kelsey and I stopped by Vino Vino this past Sunday for a snack. She recommended it while we were watching football. FULL DISCLOSURE: I was already pretty drunk by the time I walked into Vino Vino.   MEAT AND CHEESE PLATE ~ 5 stars ~ $16: You get to make your own plate. From their awesome selection, you get to pick 2 cheeses and 2 meats. All plates are served with fig &amp; hazelnut panforte, fresh fruit, bread, fruit tapenade and honey.   CHEESE OPTIONS: Pecorino Romano, Creamy Blue, Bella Dry Jack, Mt Tam, Humboldt Fog, Perfette Pecorino, Wookey Cheddar  MEAT OPTIONS: Prosciutto di Parma, Speck Alto Adige, Felcineo Mortadella w/ Pistachio, Fra&#39; Mani Smoked Ham, Molinari Finocchiona, Hot Sopressata  Kesley doesn&#39;t eat meat so we both agreed that she&#39;d decide on the cheese while I decided on the meats. She picked the Mt Tam and Humbolt Fog. I went with the Prosciutto di Parma and Hot Sopressata.   MT TAM (CHEESE) - Creamy and buttery. Very easy to spread on bread. I highly recommend this.   HUMBOLDT FOG (CHEESE) - I don&#39;t remember much about this cheese but I&#39;m sure it was good because, overall, I was very pleased with the whole plate. No complaints.   HOT SOPRESSATA (MEAT) - Great spice and perfect texture. It&#39;s what you expect from good sopressata. I recommend this.   PROSCIUTTO DI PARMA (MEAT) - OH. MY. EFFING. GOD. I literally could have died a very happy man after experiencing these perfectly sliced, perfectly flavored, perfectly textured and perfectly PERFECT sheets of heaven. If I could place a crown on a slab of Vino Vino&#39;s proscuitto and proclaim it the king of the charcuterie kingdom, I would. When you bite into it, it feels hearty and then it literally starts to melt in your mouth. The amazing flavor takes over your palate and then you experience a dry, salty, clean finish. It was so pure. I fell in love.   Dear Vino Vino Proscuitto, until we meet again... Stay classy and beautiful. I will be seeing you soon.  
                  Great atmosphere, layed back, amazing food, definitely the place to go..loved walking around San Pedro square and being able to finish our evening here. Our waitress Perla was amazing as well. Perfect experience..  
                  The thing that gets me about this place is that even though the food and wine don&#39;t stand out on their own, they complimented each other. It&#39;s a taste of Napa in downtown SJ without the fields of green and the drive. It&#39;s crowded and cramped but there always seems to be a seat for you. The service was a delight with helpful recommendations. This wine and dine layout is easier to miss as it is a few steps passed the entrance so be sure to slow down on your way in to San Pedro Square.  The wine sampler of 4 was a convenient option since I couldn&#39;t decide what to try. The  sauvignon blanc and merlot were good while the other two resembled cough syrup. The  Smoked Salmon Crostini is a complimentary appetizer that is provided when you enter your number on their site. The Caprese Prosciutto panini was also delicious.  
                  I am a big fan of Vino Vino!  I came here last Sunday for brunch with my sister because I woke up that morning wanting wine, cheese and charcuterie.  We ordered 2 wine flights and asked our server to choose for us.  It was a total of 8 types of wine.  4 whites and 4 reds.  All were very good, some better than others, but our server made a good choice.  Their meat and cheese platter was amazing!  I can literally eat it all day long.  We ordered the creamy blue, Wookey cheddar, prosciutto and the hot Sopressata.  The board was served with bread, fruit, honey, and their seasonal spread.  All were amazingly good!  I&#39;d never think to put honey on cheese, but it was so good.  It&#39;s my new obsession.  We also ordered the brie, fig and prosciutto crostini which is delicious!  A must try!  Could be their best item on the menu.  They also make that as a panini!  WONDERFUL!  I would recommend this place to anyone.  The service is kind of slow, not a place to go if you&#39;re in a rush, but the food definitely makes up for it.  I will be back!  
                  A great spot in the San Pedro Square to catch up over appetizers and drinks. There was a private party going on inside, so our group of a dozen had the outdoor tables to ourselves with the heated lamps.  Our server, Crystal, was great from start to finish, very attentive and gave good recommendations as well. Appetizers were great, cheese/meat plates and crostinis, and prices were very fair. We also did not get charged a cake cutting fee which is a plus!  Would definitley come back again!  
                  Nice wait staff.  Nice looking too.  Bar is small and tables are solid.  Panini is alright.  Flights of wine is alright.  A bit pricey.  
                  3.5 Stars,   Great prices here, and they have a happy hour, but the selection is all Local.   Normally I would be excited by local wine, but they have a lot of stuff from Gilroy, Morgan Hill, etc that is not that great.   Most bottles are under $40 here, so great value if you can find something you like.   The service was very good, but they did not have any higher-end options, or good choices for wines by the glass.   I ended up getting a Dogfish head beer at the end,   They have the Sparkling wine from Guglielmo....SCARY  
                  &#34;White wine is like electricity. Red wine looks and tastes like a liquified beefsteak.&#34;   James Joyce  Sidney has a 3 Stars Night and ticks off a few of his Yelp friends Part II  Oh well, my Northern Cal Yelp friends will be upset at me but after two visits here, this is not a 4 to 5 star wine bar.  A-Ok fits the bill perfectly.  Vino Vino started September 2011 at the San Pedro Square Market.  One of the first tenants of this development, they have an innovative 13 wine tap system (currently 4 whites and 9 reds) and feature local wines from the Santa Clara Valley, Livermore, Monterey, Hollister and other Bay Area producers.  They promise a wine bar in a beer garden setting, or as their website puts it, Wine Without The Attitude.    Or consistent service it seems.  Both times I have been there, with different yelpers, we received inconsistent service by generally sweet, nice, very attractive young women who were either too busy or too new to really perform their jobs effectively.  We were either ignored on arrival, or requests were forgotten, waters not refilled; maybe the place isn&#39;t snobby but if snobby wine bars give good service, give me the snobs!  (And as an aside, what Bay area wine bar really is snobby?  I&#39;ve been in this area less than a year and the places I enjoy -Cin Cin, Wine Affairs, Vino Locale - certainly do not have an attitude so that declaration of Wine Without The Attitude seems more marketing schtick than actual reality).  Last night was just desserts and Vino (J Pinot Gris for the other Yelper, a red flight tasting for me) but on my previous visit I had crostini, salad and cheese plate.  Cheese plate was dropped off without explanation and it was fun to play guess the cheese.  The salad and other appetizer was just okay and not worth full price.  The desserts are not made in house and the chocolate cake was a too sweet and cloying disappointment. However, the Tiramisu was very good and the cheesecake with a hint of lemon was outstanding.    Wines, as mentioned before, are primarily local with the tap wines served Italian restaurant style in glorified juice glasses.  This has the effect of rendering the taste of the wines to just their primary flavors eliminating any complexity.  Also, you are handed the wines with a little note card and the servers clearly have not been trained on wine service.  Again, I&#39;m sorry but if having an attitude means serving wine in proper stemware and having staff that know a bit about what they are serving than please give me some f&amp;%&amp;*ing attitude!  Wine without attitude served in this fashion is just wine served with ignorance and based on the Nor Cal wine bars I have come to enjoy, Vino Vino seems to be attempting to solve a problem that doesn&#39;t exist.  But, I understand I&#39;m in the minority here.  The place was busy on both weeknights I visited and all of my Yelp friends reviews are enthusiastic 4 &amp; 5 star reviews.  Swim against the tide Sidney!! Swim against the tide!  
                  I&#39;ve been alone with you inside my mind, And in my dreams, I&#39;ve craved you a thousand times, I sometimes see you passing San Pedro Square. Hello! It&#39;s Vino Vino, I&#39;ve been looking for. You can see it in my eyes, You can see it in my smile. You&#39;re all I&#39;ve ever wanted....  Seriously though, that&#39;s just how I feel about Vino Vino. It&#39;s exactly what I needed a casual wine bar to explore my taste for wine. I am by no means a wine expert and I have no interest in being intimidated by a fancy wine menu. Vino Vino has wine on tap... Totally casual. Their wine glasses are stemless , trendy, and... Casual.  The seating style is communal and cozy. Vino Vino is the definition of comfort in my opinion.    I absolutely love the cheese and meat boards. The onion jam goes great with just about everything. It&#39;s actually my favorite. Also their mini toast bread goes great with Brie and honey. Their crostinis are also quite tasty. I love love love their Brie and Fig crostini. The smoked salmon and bruschetta are good as well. As for desserts, I have only tried their chocolate truffle cake. It&#39;s really rich and definitely calls for more wine or ice cream. I recommend this only to chocolate lovers. It&#39;s also best shared.  So if you&#39;re looking into trying some local wine but not comfortable with your wine palate maturity, come here. They&#39;ll definitely hook you up with wine samples, recommendations, and food pairings.  
                  Finally got to try the food here and was very impressed. I recommend the following :  - Salmon Crostinis make a tasty appetizer, the portions are small, so you might want to order 2 of these  - Seared ahi tuna salad Came in a great portion, with healthy greens, and the dressing that came with it was delicious  -Creme brulee Always a tasty dessert  -Chocolate truffle cake or if you are craving something more rich/chocolately, this is also a delightful choice.  
                  Jenna was very helpful and has a great personality!  Had very good suggestions on both wines and good! I ended up getting J. Dowd Cabernet Sauvignon and my boyfriend got the Sangiovese, both were awesome!! We had the salmon crostini which was amazing and I highly recommend.   Will definitely return!
