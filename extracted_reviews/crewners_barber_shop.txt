                  I have been getting my hair cut by Dan for over 3 years now. After years of looking for a good stylist at a salon I decided to give him a go. Most stylists in the past took 45 mins to an hour to cut my hair. Understandably it is on the thicker side but I am in and out of Dan&#39;s chair in 20 mins with a perfect cut every time. I don&#39;t know any busy guy that has time to spend an hour in someone&#39;s chair. Dan and his crew are always professional and highly skilled. This is the place for the discerning gentleman.  Tip: Schedule a few days in advance. It&#39;s worth it.  
                  I moved here from Chicago and it took me 3 years to find someone who will always be at the same place, good price, and high quality hair cut every time and Dan was the man.  He is very accommodating and great to talk too. If you want a quality hair cut and shave with an experience barber at a good price and will always deliver, then Crewners Barber shop is the place to be.  
                  I&#39;ve been coming to Dan since 2013 and I couldn&#39;t imagine going to another barber. Dan, and his entire crew are very respectful, skilled and it&#39;s a pleasure every time I go.  Since 2013, they have expanded from a one-chair shop to a three-chair but the quality hasn&#39;t faltered. For the price, there&#39;s no beating Crewners.  Thanks again, Dan.  
                  I&#39;ve been coming to Dan and Crewners since he opened shop. I&#39;ve been in for shaves, head shaves, crew cuts, classic cuts, and walk in touch-ups.   Recently Dan expanded and moved up to three chairs. Practically an empire.  For the first time he is able to take in walk-ins for more than just a cleanup. It makes a big difference, especially because Dan used to be booked weeks out and now I can get in to see him within a few days. More chairs also means full time staff working in the same quality way that Crewners always has. In fact Dan was giving points to his employees even while I was getting all the hair taken from my scalp.   It is reassuring that someone go knows me, knows his business, treats his staff right, and does a great job is not only working downtown, but is thriving.   Just go. Don&#39;t trust me though. Trust Dan.  
                  Dan and his hand selected staff are amazing. I have been going to Dan since he first got his 1 chair in San Pedro Square Market.  I&#39;ve also gotten cuts from Alex and Kelli the two other barbers and its the same top of the line quality.   Crewners will be your go-to barber within 1 visit!  
                  Dan is AWESOME!!! My son has been getting crew cuts from Dan for over a year.  Dan has always been polite, full of manners, respectful and always treated him like he was number 1.  His professionalism is outstanding. Now lets talk about his shop....I LOVE IT!!!  You feel like you walked back in time with a modern touch.  My son has never had a cut he didn&#39;t like.  
                  I&#39;ve been a customer of Crewners for about a year now. The service I receive from Dan is always outstanding. Dan is not only a great barber, but he is also an incredibly professional business owner who sincerely cares about the life and well being of his customers. I remember talking to him about how he was going to expand his one chair shop to the three chair shop Crewners is today and I was really excited. His service has remained top notch through everything. Thanks Dan!  
                  I&#39;ve been going here for over a year,from when it was a single chair shop to the new renovations adding two additional chairs. I refuse to get my hair cut anywhere else. The cuts are always consistent,clean,and exactly what I want everytime. Hands down the best place to get your hair cut in San Jose for men in my opinion.  
                  Had a great experience this past weekend. My boyfriend came in with a full head of hair (down to his bum) and wanted to donate his hair as well after the cut. Both Barbers there got to braiding in seconds and made my hunny feel well taken care of. We have more than enough hair to donate, thanks to Crewners staff! Alex did an amazing job. He did everything we asked for and he laughed at my jokes, so he&#39;s awesome in my book!! We&#39;ll be back for a trim in 6-8 weeks!! Thanks again for helping my man out with a life changing experience!! You guys were so awesome !!  
                  For me &#34;Dan&#39; is a magician. He picked up the wreck (read my - Hairstyle), suggested what will look good and voila it did look good.  getting an appointment is always a little tricky but you can always plan atleast a week in advance.  My recommendation to any first timer: Do go and give this place a try. I am sure, its not going to be disappointing.   Cheers  
                  I&#39;ve been coming to Crewner&#39;s since Dan was a one-man shop! I love the fact that you can book your appointments online months in advance and avoid sitting in line for your turn.  Dan and the rest of his staff are exceptionally-skilled barbers who know your style and also make great recommendations if you&#39;re looking for something new.  In addition, the actual shop has a cool vibe, good music, good movies playing in the background and good barber shop talk.  I always enjoy chopping it up with Dan.  I highly recommend you give it a try!  
                  When I first moved to San Jose I was anxious to find a new barber since I&#39;m very particular about my hair. After doing some research I found Dan the man and I haven&#39;t looked back since. Dan is a true gentleman who is meticulous about his craft and is one of the few barbers who knows how to groom my stubborn, asian hair. Although I&#39;m a broke college kid, his haircuts are worth every penny as they leave me with the confidence I need to win at life everyday. I&#39;ve been trusting Dan with my haircuts for almost a year now, and he has yet to disappoint. If you&#39;re looking for a consistent barber, Dan is your man!  
                  Crewners recently expanded, and there are now three chairs where there used to be one. It&#39;s even easier to get an appointment when you need one, and everyone on staff provides the same excellent service that Dan has always been known for. The expanded shop looks great, and has an upscale feel that is right in line with the high quality Crewners vibe. Somehow, this already fantastic shop got even better!  
                  Alex did a very good job. The whole experience felt very professional. They went from 1 chair to 4 I believe in just a few years.   They had a movie playing in the background for entertainment as well.   $35 for a great haircut. Gave me a discount on styling wax.  
                  I&#39;ve been coming to Crewners since May of 2014. It took me a while to convince myself I can splurge $30+ for a haircut, seeing as how I&#39;ve been getting $10 haircuts for ... oh, almost all my life. So, to maintain my frugal nature, I now get haircuts once every 3 months instead of once a month. Besides, I&#39;m used to deciding on a haircut last minute, and if any of you have seen Dan&#39;s booking schedule.. you&#39;re looking at a few weeks out at a time. But I figured it&#39;s time I wrote a review for Dan&#39;s services.  So far, it&#39;s been a good ride. This last week, I brought my wife in to meet Dan. This was how I introduced him:  &#34;Hi Dan, this is my wife Alice. Alice, this is Dan, the man who makes me look and feel beautiful.&#34;  Actually, on that last trip, we brought my father-in-law in for a haircut. Dan was the consummate professional and gentleman, as he always is.   One thing I like about Dan is that he remembers your preferences for how to cut and style your hair, and works with you to plan a cut that will let your hair grow into the style you want. That was the thing that impressed me the most: having suffered - no, that&#39;s too strong a word - let&#39;s say, having become accustomed to haircuts that involve a #2 guard and not much more, it was a delight to be able to talk to Dan about how I&#39;d like my hair, to hear him talking out what he&#39;s doing with the cut and explaining how it will grow out, and seeing it grow out just the way he had explained - I felt like I was working with a true craftsman who wasn&#39;t cutting just for what looks best in the chair right then, cutting with a vision of what&#39;s to come.   As I&#39;m approaching that age where my hair might start thinning, I&#39;ve decided that I want to take good care of what I still have and cherish the time we have together. So far, Dan&#39;s the man for the job.  (Somewhere, someone is reading this review and thinking, &#34;Man, it&#39;s just a haircut. Are you really going to wax so poetic?&#34; To which I would respond, &#34;Then why are you reading reviews for Crewners?&#34;)  Oh, and speaking of booking out a few weeks at a time, this past week, Dan has been very gracious to squeeze me in last minute for a much-needed haircut, but I will try not to abuse the system and go by the appointment system.  
                  My fiancé has been seeing Dan for nearly three years now and couldn&#39;t be happier with the service he receives at Crewners. In fact, last year we moved down to Orange County and he refuses to find a new barber down here because he has been so pleased with his Crewners experience. Dan really worked with him to understand the specific style he wanted, and my fiancé fears he won&#39;t find anyone with the encyclopedic knowledge of men&#39;s hair and personable demeanor anywhere else. Though he usually books appointments with Dan, he has also seen other stylists and been equally as happy with the result. Furthermore, the whole style of the place is a fun environment to be in. Dan has really curated the experience masterfully with unexpected antique and retro details. I usually accompany my fiancé to his appointments because the location of Crewners is ideal for getting lunch or coffee before or afterwards. Finally, the online booking system is super convenient. Oh yeah, and did I mention the haircuts are always spot on? Overall, a great San Jose institution that not only offers great haircuts but also has greatly revitalized DTSJ.  
                  I have been coming to see Dan at Crewners for years and he is awesome! I remember the days of the one chair shop and it is cool to see it grow to three chairs recently. No matter how big or small, Crewners never disappoints with quality and service. This is an awesome place to come for a haircut and talk local sports!  
                  When I first moved to San Jose in 2010 to start college I needed a new image - Dan Dixon was there to provide that new image. Flash forward five years later and he has not stopped providing. Every time I ask for a surprise new haircut this guy never ceases to amaze - It&#39;s like he just seems to know the types of haircuts that compliments my style and persona.   You owe it to yourself to at least try Crewner&#39;s out - Dan &#34;The Man&#34; Dixon won&#39;t disappoint.  
                  Best place in the Bay Area! I get my hair cut by kelly and she&#39;s awesome! Everyone there has great talent and amazing customer service. If you&#39;re looking for a haircut, book your appointment online, it&#39;s so convenient. I will never go anywhere else.  
                  Been coming to Crewners for almost two years now and I must say you are in great hands no matter who you get a haircut from.  The people, environment and quality of service are all top notch.  I recommend this place to everyone I know.  
                  I have been going to Dan for about 2 years now and he is the most professional, courteous, and exceptional barber I have encountered thus far. He knows exactly what kind of cut I want and always does a great job in a timely manner. He uses warm shaving cream and a straight razor shave on the back of the neck; a nice way to end a fantastic haircut. I had been a regular since before his remodel and now, his place looks great and gives off a very luxurious feel that turns a haircut into an experience. I&#39;m usually 5-6 minutes late and he is always very understanding and accommodating. I feel very comfortable in Dan&#39;s hands and will be a regular customer for a long, long time.  
                  Best Barber Shop I have ever been to! I have been coming here since it was a single chair shop with Dan and the service/cuts have never failed! After moving to the area and having a few failed attempts at finding the right barber, i now call this place my home barbershop. The attention to detail, conversation, and atmosphere, all make this place the best barbershop around! The new expansion looks great as well!  
                  I started getting my haircut at Crewner&#39;s since I moved up to San Jose from LA in 2011. Dan is a magician...and an incredible conversationalist to boot!. I never thought much about haircuts before going to Crewners, but Dan does such a great job that I would never think about going anywhere but Crewners in the future.  Yes, you have to book in advance. You&#39;ve got the rest of your life on iCal--you owe it to yourself to make sure you&#39;ve got a spot with the Crewners crew to make sure that you&#39;re always looking your best!  
                  Following up on this, I stand firmly by my words.  Despite Crewner&#39;s expansions, the customer service and quality of the haircuts I receive has remained unchanged- excellent.  I always look forward to my 30 minutes with Dan!  
                  Fast service and none of that fake chit chat. Humble and to the point. The cut was stylish and to my liking, as I brought in a picture of what I wanted. Prices are reasonable for the San Jose area. This is not some barber in your friend&#39;s garage. You definitely get what you pay for.  
                  This was my first time going to Crewners. I took a chance after reading over all the positive reviews on Yelp. Great location, great ambience, and a very cool stylish looking barbershop inside the market. A+ for Alex E. he was my barber and he did a killer job on my long overdue haircut. I will continue to use Alex from this day forth. Thank you again Alex  
                  I am currently living in Boulder, CO and stopped by Crewners today for a cut while I was visiting my Dad.   My first impression was that it was a very clean, comfortable establishment.  I felt very relaxed coming in there for my first time and will definitely be back.   My cut was with Dan, very professional and courteous.  Easy guy to talk to and made me feel like my business was very appreciated.  The actual cut was incredible and for a while I have been struggling to find my specific look but Dan really blew it out of the park.  He gave me exactly what I was looking for even though I wasn&#39;t totally sure what that was when I went in there.  One of the greatest things is that he emailed me exactly what he did so I can easily tell my barber back in Boulder what I want.  Definitely a great guy with some serious hair cutting skills.    I will be back and am very excited for my next visit.  
                  I went to see Dan twice before my wedding for a haircut and shave. He cleaned me up really well. My wife loved the look! That&#39;s what matters most.  Thanks so much Dan!  
                  If you are reading this, you probably walked by and were curious.  If you are reading this, you are probably also worried that you are in a fish bowl and everyone will stare at you.  If you are reading this, you are probably have a sense of style.  If you are reading this, you probably have tried many different barbers, but with mixed results.  I&#39;ll save you the time.  Book an appointment.  You know that feeling when you leave the bank after making a big deposit? That feeling of leaving the gym after a great workout?  Smashing that exam back in college?  Leaving crewners feels like that.   Why are you scrolling down to read more reviews?  Every other review says the same exact thing. Just book an appointment.  
                  Came here to get hubby a shave and hair cut. This guy is awesome! He was not only very professional but took great care in making sure hubby and I were satisfied with the shave and haircut!  I also recognized him and he was kind enough to tell us about the shows he has been in and the expansion he is making.   We wish him the best and a must go next time we are in town!  
                  Being in the customer service industry myself I take it very serious and important. Dan has a great demeanor ive been getting my hair done by him for a few months now I never knew you could get your hair cut without clippers almost scalping you but he does it I barely feel the cut yet it&#39;s close as ever. I don&#39;t see myself leaving anytime soon finally found a barber that does it all  
                  CREWNERS is far the best barber shop I&#39;ve been in to. I was super happy I booked my appointment with Dan and took a leap of faith to creating a new hair look!   Thank you to Janet O. for her fail-proof recommendation! I&#39;ve had my previous barber for the past 3+ years and I needed a new change because the prices kept going up. My haircuts weren&#39;t as great and CONSISTENT on my every visit. So I got tired of that place and needed a new barber.. then I found Crewners.   The process was super easy and fast. You can just book an appointment online, but it might take at least a week to get an appointment because Dan is super booked with awesome clients! No doubt.   Dan is by far the most professional barber I have ever met. He is super knowledgeable, timeless, interactive man who knows how to cut hair. He takes huge pride and passion to make his work an art. He doesn&#39;t half-ass on his job. He takes it to his fullest. This is what I like about him! He doesn&#39;t make me feel like customer that just comes in to get a haircut and go out. He treats his people with care and making sure that you&#39;re comfortable and happy with the results.   Yes, this is a ONE man barber shop... Solely focused on YOU. This what makes Crewners very special... The chair was hella comfortable, by the way. The room is super tidy and has this timeless atmosphere feel, with a flat screen tv facing for you to watch while getting your hair chopped. He also does razor on your neck lines on the back, SAY WHAT?! I&#39;ve never any barber shop that does this. It was definitely a whole new experience.  I was super happy with my new look. I will definitely come back here for my next appointment before Christmas! Thank you so much, Dan!   ***They will be expanding sometime next year with more Crewners crews to speed up the demands!***  
                  I&#39;ve been coming to Dan to get my haircut for almost two years now and he&#39;s the best barber I&#39;ve ever had. I travel a lot for work but I always make it point to get my cuts here. His cuts are blazingly fast and I&#39;ve had nothing but perfect experiences. His shop is clean, classy, and has the best hair products. Check this out the next time you need a superb cut. You won&#39;t be disappointed.  
                  Corey S. Is so dope! His hands has so much swag!!! He is just an amazing barber/stylist, with an amazing attitude and sense of humor. He has made me laugh so hard, and he will make you feel like one of his homies. Not only is he great at his craft, but he has rhythm. As in he knows how to dance! One time he busted out in the Dougie dance! I didn&#39;t know what the Dougie dance was up until that point. So I guess you can say he taught me how to Dougie, like the song! Lol!  Oh yes! Very  honest barber, and coolest mustache too!  
                  Went in last week with my man to get a haircut. Dan is a magician when it comes to cutting hair! My guy has never looked better!  
                  Dan is really the man! Prompt. Professional. Dapper and charming! Mix that with his five years plus knowledge of the art of barbering. He&#39;s a gem in the middle of this food Mecca.  Being new with short hair and an admirer of all things modern and sleek I came to see Dan recently with a 12:30 appointment. He was on time and not a moment wasted waiting to see him.   Obviously he thought my appointment was not for me :) It&#39;s normal. I expected that.  I was honest and told him I heard that he is a master of what suits each individual. So I described what I wanted or more like showed him a picture. He went to work and I felt the relaxing snip snip of a straight razor for the first time. It was very relaxing! No scissors was used on me.   Each client is given a half hour undivided attention for their Crewners Signature Cut. You will get: Consultation, precision haircut, style with product, straight razor neck shave, post shave Clubman cologne &amp; talc. $35  No. I did not get a shave. Although I do wish I have some neck hair worth shaving. Must be super relaxing! No Clubman cologne either. Why? Because it&#39;s called a Clubman cologne? Duhh. Why not since I&#39;m in a barber shop? And might as well?  Well because I don&#39;t want to smell like a dude!   So I got the whole half hour of Dan making sure I look my best. Now I know what a proper short cut is. I&#39;m learning. Having fun while doing it. #hairgrowsback#dontbeafraid  
                  Ok, so before coming here, I&#39;ve always passed by this place thinking, &#34;Damn, this is pretty cool...one day I&#39;ll get a cut here.&#34; But I didn&#39;t want to escape my cheap $15 clipper fade/wash spot in a seedy part of San Jose. Fast forward to last week where I&#39;m due for my first summer cut of 2015 and my awesome wife has an appointment with Dan lined up right before we go out to the city for our anniversary dinner.  Dan was my barber for this session and there were a bit of nerves trying out a new barber right before you go out to a 3 michelin star rated restaurant dressed to the nines with a crappy cut. A crappy cut was the furthest thing as Dan gave me a precise 1-3 fade on the sides and back with tight neck lines. All places I had been to only fade with guards, but I thought it was interesting that he switched blades...all of which resulted in a really tight and even fade. I finished off this appointment with a nice and relaxing traditional straight razor shave with all your usual hot towel, hot lather fixins.   Ambiance was great with Captain America playing on the flatscreen, great conversation to get to know Dan&#39;s story and some nice 1920s ragtime music during the shave for that old school feel. I&#39;m looking forward to moving on from the $15 cut I had grown so comfortable and accustomed to and upping my montly cuts to the first class experience that is Crewners.  
                  The absolute best barber in San Jose, with an amazing vibe, a comfortable leather chair, and a super professional job. Dan has got some great stories but he doesn&#39;t talk your ear off. A flatscreen tv on the wall plays films if that&#39;s your thing, but the conversation is great here.  MAKE AN APPOINTMENT! They do not take walkins, and these guys are booked up weeks if not months in advance because they are so good. Get in the rotation and make regular visits. You will not regret it!  
                  Hands down best haircut experience ever. Great location and a cool vibe. Dan is a consumate professional and did a great job preparing me for my wedding next week. I love my haircut and his knowledge of product was great. Definitely recommend him and his shop to anyone.  
                  My boyfriend came here to get his haircut &amp; i think i am more thrill with the result than he is! Andre did a great job! (=  Will definitely have him come back.  
                  They are really good with their haircuts.   Downfall is waiting ! Especially when someone comes late messes everyone else&#39;s appointments.  
                  I am writing this the day after my third appointment with Dan, and he&#39;s done it again.  Three consistent, beautiful haircuts. Three professional interactions. Three great, personable conversations. Three experiences worth writing about.  And for the three appointments I have had so far, Crewners deserves 5 out of 5 stars on Yelp. Seriously. Go book an appointment. The website is nicely designed too. The location is perfect in San Pedro Square. I usually grab a beer and dinner with my buddy after my haircut and make an evening out of my appointments. The shop itself is clean and has a classic, warm atmosphere that enhances the whole experience.  Dan himself deserves stellar praise. He has been a professional each time and very welcoming. He&#39;s also awesome to talk to while getting your hair cut. I have a great time hanging out with this guy, which I found pretty uncommon in my past experiences with barbers. On top of that, he has given me great insight about my hair and which products to use. I was left speechless at the end of my first appointment when Dan handed me a mirror to check out his work, and that feeling is consistent at the end of each cut.  I look forward to each appointment I have with Dan not only because of the haircut,  but also the awesome time I have being his client. Crewners is hands down an authentic experience .  
                  Stopped in unexpectedly at Crewners for a haircut. Dan was awesome! Great haircut and great atmosphere. Will definitely go back.  
                  Great place! Alex cut my hair and I already scheduled my next appointment with him. Scheduling online was convenient.  As others stated, they get booked a few weeks in advanced, but this helps plan out my cuts.  I would recommend this place to any guy especially if you are in the downtown area.  
                  New regular barber shop! Dan acted as a consultant, asking questions to guide his trimmers just so. &#34;Do you use your part line?&#34; is a question I&#39;ve never been asked, he cut my hair so perfectly to accommodate the way I style it, rather than just seating me and making my hair shorter and saying goodbye. The excellent ambiance only added to the experience, high high recommendation from me.  
                  After only 2 experiences here they have earned a customer for life. Guess I shouldn&#39;t say &#34;they&#34;, though, as it is a one chair shop and I&#39;ve only dealt with the owner Dan. Have recently been dealing with some health issues and Dan went above and beyond the call of duty to make sure I looked my best for the upcoming holiday celebrations. Above and beyond any service I have ever received from any business in my 37 years! Just saw him 2 days ago and can&#39;t wait to do it again. Thanks, Dan! Cheers!  Bane ;)  
                  Dan is the man.  I&#39;m writing this on behalf of my boyfriend. Apparently, he&#39;s seen this place and have always wanted to try.  $35 for a men&#39;s cut.  And nice real old fashion, classy barber shop experience.  Something different than the $8 fade he usually gets at some local Vietnamese spot.  I decided to hang out as we had plans afterwards.  And to be honest, I was curious with what Dan could do.  My boyfriend has been growing his hair out and it&#39;s been getting caveman status.  He&#39;s resorted to just wear a hat all day because his hair was too much. Don&#39;t get me wrong, he&#39;s handsome either way, but you know...curiosity.  Anyway, we arrived, there were two chairs people could hang out at.  My bf told Dan, &#34;You can do anything.  I&#39;ll trust you,&#34;  Dan asked me and I said the same.  I busted out a laptop to do some work and once and a while looked up to see what Dan was doing.  He looked like he took his craft very seriously.  You can tell he was impeccable concerning details.  He also explained why he did certain cuts and his advice on products to do with certain lengths.  End result, everyone was happy.  I haven&#39;t see my boyfriend&#39;s face in so long.  Mullet is gone! haha  My bf seems thrilled with the do.  He was extremely satisfied.  On Dan&#39;s part, he seemed very accommodating with customers as well.  You can save a block of time every X amount of weeks out for a new cut.  On top of it, he said he&#39;s free to do touch ups for free! Super great deal.  
                  Decided to take a chance on this place and boy did I make a great decision. I got a cut from Corey and he is the best! Very friendly and welcoming. He knows his stuff and I walked out with the best haircut I ever had!  
                  Once you start going to Crewners you won&#39;t want to go anywhere else. The service is personalized, no one is trying to push unnecessary product on you, and best of all the haircuts are top notch. I&#39;ve been going here for a couple of years now and have used three of their barbers - all of which have given consistently solid cuts. The only downside to Crewners is that they are usually booked a few weeks in advance, so you have to plan ahead to get a cut. This has led to a few circumstances where I&#39;ve had to get a cut from another barbershop and boy can you tell the difference. I highly recommend the crew at Crewners.  
                  I have been getting my hair cut by Dan for over a year now and have nothing but positive feedback about my experiences. Dan is very professional and takes time to get to know his clients and seems very concerned that they are satisfied with the services provided. The environment in the shop is peaceful and tranquil which makes me feel comfortable and relaxed each time I get a haircut and shave. Dan is also probably the only barber who I have gotten a haircut from which has resulted in random people coming up to me telling me &#34;wow that is a nice haircut&#34;.  
                  Just got back from my first experience with Dan and I am super stoked. I booked about 2 weeks in advance and will probably book when I start to get scraggly again. Dan is very good at what he does and efficient for a 30 min cut and beard trim.   Can&#39;t recommend Crewner&#39;s enough.  
                  I have been going to Crewners for the past 2 years and WOW, was impressed each and every time with the quality of service. Dan is a very talented barber that does a fantastic job. It&#39;s a very professional, classy and awesome ambiance. He has taken getting a haircut to the next level, he is easy to talk to and with his experience is capable of doing what you want as well as offering suggestions. He is very accommodating and will work with you to make it as easy as possible.  Love that he does a straight razor shave, you don&#39;t find too many barbers that do this anymore. He has recently expanded his business and it looks awesome, go online and book an appointment with any of the talented staff, you wont be disappointed. I unfortunately had to be relocated for work out of state and know i wont find another barber like Dan Dixon. If you live in the San Jose area this is the best place for a men&#39;s haircut!  
                  Great service, super friendly and very professional. I am a student and didn&#39;t think the price wasn&#39;t that bad $18. Honestly worth it. I felt very comfy watching netflix something you choose to watch as Dan focuses on your hair. If you want a great hair cut and/or shave this is the place to try.  Mr. C  
                  I couldn&#39;t be more pleased with how Corey cut my hair. Today was my second visit with him (Corey works exclusively on Mondays) and both times I looked in the mirror when he finished and thought &#34;Damn that looks good!&#34; After years of having the same haircut, Crewners has given me some style. Corey is the newest addition to the Crewners family and he can definitely can count me as a regular. The way Crewners is set up is very convenient. You schedule a 30 minute appointment, show up on time, and you are on your way a half an hour later. No more blocking off half a day to get your haircut, or bringing a book to offset the wait. The place is classy and runs efficiently. Great concept and I am a happy customer!  
                  I had a fantastic experience with Dan.   I went in looking for a particular type of cut (after making my booking 3 weeks in advance of course). After a detailed consultation, Dan was very forthright that certain types of &#34;modern&#34; styles are not exactly his forte, and that I would probably need to wait several months to grow my hair out before he could actually take it where I wanted it to go (which was a pretty long hair cut style though my hair is currently short lol...).  Regardless of that, he still took the time to give me a trim to shape up my hair, and brought in a meticulous style and care and attention, and at the end of it all he told me my hair cut was free, and even recommended a specific stylist near by who could do what I was looking for.  Not only is Dan meticulous and thorough, but operates with &#34;old fashioned&#34; values and business ethics to match his vintage hair styles. If I ever need a classic cut I know exactly where to go and recommend friends.   Also the barber shop is a cool wood and glass box in the middle of a busy dining area so gets some hipster cred there.  
                  Still as good as it gets.  All the negative reviews are crazy, for example, Mary N&#39;s review...I&#39;ve been getting my haircut since day one at Crewners and never once did it have a sign that says &#34;we accept walk ins&#34; so to try to blatantly lie to try to tarnish Dan&#39;s business is utterly pathetic!  The same goes for Raja&#39;s review...Dan is a one chair barber. He has to book by appointment only. That&#39;s how his particular business model works and it&#39;s effective, as he saw that Dan is booked out 4-5 weeks in advance. He can service a greater number of clients on a given day this way and streamline his business and be more efficient in the process. To say there is no parking is humorous, as there is a towering four story parking garage directly across the street.  
                  What can I say that another 168 people have not said about Dan and Crewners Barbershop? I guess nothing &#34;new&#34; but I&#39;ll go ahead and pile on for good measure.   After jumping around a few barber shops and men&#39;s salons to find the &#34;perfect&#34; cut, I finally ventured into Dan&#39;s shop. At first I thought I was in the wrong spot! Placed in the middle of all the restaurants in San Pedro Square, it is a one seat glass observatory.   Now Dan is absolutely fantastic with his cuts. He is also extremely knowledgable on what fits your face and will ask a lot of questions to make sure you get exactly what you want. I basically gave him the gist of what I wanted then I told him to use his best judgement for what he believed looked good. The results were amazing. I glad to have found my barber for the rest of my life!  This post is mostly for Dan but I&#39;ve also had a cut with Andre and he is also very good but I prefer Dan&#39;s old school style and eye more. However you won&#39;t go wrong with either.   TIP: they do not take walk ins and appointments book up atleast 3 weeks in advance. Some planning is needed to from to Crewners but it is well worth your time.  
                  I always joke with my buddies, &#39;That&#39;s right, keep the same haircut for ten years.&#39; How fun is that?   - Tom Brady  We won&#39;t have our hair forever so learn from an older guys mistakes and don&#39;t stick with a mediocre barber just because he&#39;s cheap and don&#39;t keep the same short-on-the-sides, little-off-the-top hairstyle for 10+ years.  I did both before meeting Dan Dixon and I am REALLY kicking myself. Most embarrassing is that on my first visit ever, he gave me the best haircut I&#39;ve ever had. There are different ways to cut, blend &amp; style your hair that - although subtle - dramatically change the way you look!  I didn&#39;t realize this but now I do. Dump your $15 barber; graduate to manhood and ... here&#39;s the hard part ... don&#39;t dictate every detail of your cut to Dan. Give him a broad, general idea of what you want and then ask him, &#34;What would you do?&#34; He knows more than you.  
                  I created this account just to be able to write this review.   First time, ever, going to a barber shop, and boy am I glad I chose Dan, here at Crewners, to be the first.   Very clean shop, very nice environment, and due to the single chair, it makes it feel like you are the center of attention.   Dan caters very well to whatever your needs are. Gives honest opinions on what looks good on you. I wasn&#39;t sure what would look good, and am very self conscious about my head, and his opinion in combination with my girlfrend&#39;s, the cut came out great. I also came for a shave, and it was a first for me getting a razor edge shave, as well.   He takes his time, and is very meticulous about his work.  I didn&#39;t realize how pleasant of an experience it would be; had I known it&#39;s like this, I would&#39;ve came to a barber shop years ago.  Many thanks again, Dan! Really appreciate it.  
                  I&#39;ve now gone to Crewners 3 times and feel like the services as well as the customer service gets better with every visit.  I came in on a Friday for an 11:30 appt during the Farmer&#39;s Market.  I didn&#39;t mind dropping the $10 on parking because I knew the experience and results would be worth it.  Dan took great care to give me a flattering and easy to maintain cut.  Then out came the hot, scented towel for the shave.  With careful and precise strokes, Dan made short work of my stubble, leaving my skin feeling smooth but not raw.  Meanwhile, Dan&#39;s repartee and banter add to the classic, upscale experience.  His knowledge of the history of the local area as well as the development scuttlebutt are fascinating.  I look forward to my next visit.  Thanks Dan, keep setting the bar high for quality men&#39;s grooming care and professionalism in our sleepy yet bustling little burg.  
                  Sometimes it is just best to go with the flow and not argue with the crowd.  Great experience.  Great environment.  Great location.  Great service.  
                  Dan is pretty freaking awesome! I got a recommendation from someone to go here for a cut. I wanted to get an undershave / nape shave done since I grew bored of my hair. I&#39;ve been to him twice so far just to get some touch ups and whatnot. Always a pleasure with Dan! He&#39;s very down-to-earth and a pretty easygoing guy. Greeted with warm smiles and excellent customer service! Dan is a professional who&#39;s very trained in his line of work and clearly loves what he does. Aside from the great haircut I received, he himself is worth a visit.  
                  If you want a haircut, don&#39;t come here.  If you want a truly personalized experience where attention to the finest detail and customer service are first and foremost, then indeed, this is your place.  Dan, however, is not a barber. He is instead a master craftsman who takes great pride in his work--  as well he should. It&#39;s the best. He completely re-worked my style in a natural way no ordinary barber nor even stylist had envisioned. Dan, my wife and I thank you (and it was a delight meeting your folks).  p.s. It doesn&#39;t hurt that Verve coffee and craft beer are nearby while you await and then celebrate your new look.  
                  Dan Dixon is an absolute pro- a guy&#39;s guy who gives great haircuts in a retro shop in San Pedro Square.  Only downside is you have to schedule in advance, but it&#39;s well worth it to get this level of cut.  
                  Corey is a professional at what he does. I basically was clueless as to what kind of hair-cut to get, and he did a great job. Delighted and will be back again.  
                  I&#39;ve been going to Andre to get my haircut for about 3 months now and all I have to say is-- I&#39;m never letting anyone else but him touch my hair again. The location is unbeatable and it has an unbeatable atmosphere that makes the experience that much more enticing. That, and Andre is very personable and makes for great conversation during the session. Not to forget that there&#39;s always a great movie playing. Make sure to book your appointments at least 3 weeks in advance to make sure you get a time in with Andre!  
                  Wife: &#34;I think this is the best haircut you&#39;ve got.&#34;    I have to agree. Told Andre a little bit of what I was looking at getting done, he got to work and boom, exactly what I wanted. Great cut, high class barber shop feel (you don&#39;t have 50 people all around you), great convo...  I&#39;ll be going here from now on.  Thanks Andre!  
                  Dan is the freaking man. I came in with mostly a verbal description about a haircut that I wanted that didn&#39;t even really exist. We talked about it for about 5 minutes while h asked me what I wanted and what to go for. He displyed that he really cares about his work and the customers happiness. He set to work and about 10 minutes later he unveiled his creation (presentation is everything) and he nailed it. It was my third going and I will be back for sure. Everytime I get great service, a fantastic haircut and all in about 15 minutes total.   Book ahead and you will not be disappointed. Dan deserves all the praise he gets.  
                  + Dan is very experienced barber + polite and friendly + quick and perfect styling  + nice location and interior  + neckline hot shave after the haircut  1 star less because I expected to get a hair wash after the haircut which is pretty common in upscale men&#39;s haircut places.  Guys, definitely give it a try atleast once and you will become their permanent customer!  
                  No frills...the best barber around! Andre is truly a man of his craft. His workmanship and passion surpassed my expectations. I wasn&#39;t too skeptical going in as the reviews were straight forward and consistent. He gives great suggestions as to what fits each individual, but never pushy on deviating from what the customer originally intended. This is the place I&#39;ve been looking for!  
                  To fully appreciate Crewners Barber Shop you first have to understand what it is - and what it is not.  WHAT IT IS: A single-chair genuine, board-certified barber shop that pays homage to the past while embracing the future. It&#39;s set in an open room in San Pedro Square surrounded by wood and glass - 100% class. Dan Dixon, owner and master barber, is a throw-back to an era that embraced the art of manliness. He&#39;s knowledgable, personable and exceptionally skilled. His customer service is off the scale. He&#39;ll give you a custom cut, tailored to your exact specifications (though I suggest allowing some room for Dan to create something even better - like I said, he&#39;s a master barber).  WHAT IT IS NOT: - A beauty parlor / hair salon. You won&#39;t find blow dryers, sinks or a color station. Don&#39;t come here to get your hair permed. This is a barber shop, man!  - A scene out of the movie Barber Shop. Don&#39;t expect a bunch of supporting characters hanging out, cracking jokes all day - this is a one-man show, you&#39;re the star and Dan is the director. - Fantastic Sams, et al. - No fresh-out-of-cosmetology-school haircuts here. This is the craftsmanship of a skilled artisan.   MY EXPERIENCE: I stumbled upon on this barbershop while exploring San Pedro Square and liked the look of it - old school in a good way. I looked Crewners up on Yelp, read the awesome reviews and went to the site to book my appointment. I took the first one I could get - Thursday at 2pm... When I got the confirmation email, I then realized it was actually 2 weeks from Thursday - DAMNIT! I sent an email to Dan that I would need to cancel as I was in desperate need of a haircut and would have to take my chances elsewhere. Dan immediately wrote back that he could squeeze me in the next day at 4:45, I jumped at it!   I showed up and met Dan, we talked through what I wanted, etc. and he then took his time giving me a great cut. Really classic side-part Madmen perfection - truly an impeccable haircut. I also noticed he carried Harry&#39;s razors and shaving cream and when I asked him about the company he told me all about them - and ended up giving me a free razor and shaving cream to take home to try out for free! WHAT?! Too much. Dan goes above and beyond - anyone who says otherwise is misinformed.   MY ADVICE: Sure, Dan can cut a high tight fade, but Picasso could also draw with crayons - Personally, I think you should let an artist work. Come in with an idea, but allow him to do what he does so well!  Make your appointment RIGHT NOW for your next haircut. Go to Crewners website and book online using the reservation system. You&#39;ll have to book in advance because not everyone will be as lucky as I was on my first appointment &amp; please don&#39;t hate me for getting in so quickly, I&#39;m Irish, we&#39;re just lucky people ;)  
                  Very cool &#34;old school&#34; feeling to it. They had the Godfather II playing on the TV with pictures of old crewners hanging on the wall.   Their professionalism is superb  as well as staying personable and friendly. Courtesy is a big deal for me.   They gave me the exact cut I wanted and stayed as detailed as possible.  
                  I&#39;ve found my barber.   Whether you know what you want, or just have an idea, Dan Dixon will get your hair cut accordingly.  I&#39;ve been here a few times now. A couple of points:  - Be sure to schedule your appointment at least a couple of weeks in advance.  - I enjoy the experience of going to his shop and knowing that I&#39;m going to be his sole focus.  - I dig the decor and ambience.  - I like the fact that I&#39;m able to communicate exactly what I want without any kind of language barrier.  In short, I don&#39;t mind paying a bit more for a haircut from Dan because I know I&#39;m getting a quality haircut with the option for free touch-ups. Every time I&#39;ve gone here I&#39;ve walked out with a satisfying haircut that looks good the moment I leave.  
                  NOT YOUR USUSAL REVIEW!!!  I set up a yelp account JUST TO WRITE THIS REVIEW.  More the reason to read further.  Had an appointment with Dan the Man and when I walked in he asked, &#34;So, ugh, what would you like to do&#34;?  Now let me inform you, I had hair past my shoulders. Definitely not the kind of hair Crewners is used to.  I told him I wanted it on top of my shoulders and he said &#34;okay.&#34;  Andre walked in right before the cut ( I had no idea who he was) and he started to talk to Dan like it was a regular day. Old friends shooting the shit, until Dan said, &#34;Hey, you up for cutting long hair?&#34;  &#34;What the....&#34; I thought and I eventually found out who he was and Dan informed me Andre has had more experience cutting long hair.  On a day he is generally off, Andre took the helm and began cutting.  After he was done with the cut, I looked in the mirror, and I don&#39;t know if Dan the Man noticed my hesitance but he said...&#34;You know what, think about the length and if you don&#39;t like it, come back. We can adjust it for you!&#34;  Nothing was wrong with the cut. It looked fine. But it was more of a conservative cut.  A few days passed, and I wanted it shorter. I sent them a picture on the style I was looking for (johnny Depp) and Dan was completely honest and said &#34; Don&#39;t think we can perfect that, *HOWEVER* I can refer you to a couple places?&#34;  I took his offer and....get this.......he REFUNDED me my haircut to apply it to the great stylist he recommended!!!  They understand how to treat people. WORLD CLASS!!!  Thank You fellas. I truly appreciate the service and my new haircut!!!!!  *****  
                  Once again if you just want to come in for a clean up... COME RIGHT IN! Dan will take care of you promptly, and professionally! What more can you ask for? Even if you&#39;re just coming in for a clean up, you&#39;re treated like another customer.  I just had to write an update because this place is that bomb. I can&#39;t recommend it enough.  
                  Life long customer here. Andre is the man, but i&#39;m sure the reviews validates that already.  
                  Dan Dixon is by far the best barber in Bay Area!. I have tried many barber shops before going to Dan and I can tell you that I don&#39;t have to try a new barber again. The customer service is excellent, just go in, ask Dan for suggestions, have a seat and watch a movie, 30 minutes later you will have the best haircut.  
                  Dear Dan Dixon,  These are the reactions I got from my loved ones post-haircut. My mom and dad had company over when I got home and they were astounded with the haircut; the people are native to Vietnam, so they thought a hairstyle that wasn&#39;t wasn&#39;t a variant of the bowl cut or the buzz cut was something only supermodels could pull off. The older folk think I&#39;m a handsome model. My friends now... oh boy. They already knew I was really into fashion, so when they saw me, they were struck with awe at the amazingness they knew they could never pull off at an Asian salon. I was so confident with this haircut, I got a number from a girl on the bus ride home. You have magic fingers Mr. Dixon and I applaud your adroitness at cutting hair. Thank you for being my wingman. Have a nice Veterans day!  Your new client,  Brian Chuc  
                  This was my first time here and the experience was amazing, within seconds Dan felt like an old friend. He knows what he&#39;s doing amd is extremely professional . With out a doubt I&#39;ll be back and could not see myself going anywhere else.  
                  Before coming to Crewners, I had the typical Asian guy faux hawk. Looking super wack and needing a change, I went into Crewners in search of a new hairstyle.   Funny enough, I passed this place many times when I would come here to eat at the San Pedro food spots. Then I decided to finally take the time to get a cut from a professional barber instead of an amateur barbershop I used to go to.   Andre Gonzales is a goddamn magician when it comes to a premium cut. I&#39;ve been coming to see him for a few years, and I&#39;m most likely never gonna go anywhere else. Not only does he understand hair, but he knows how to work with my annoying Vietnamese hair.   I went from looking like the average Asian kid to a dapper, suave haired individual in such a short amount of time. Since my first cut, Andre has worked with my hair and perfected what I am proud of. It&#39;s almost so flawless that I&#39;ll probably never change my hairstyle now.   To add onto the ideal haircut, the setting is beyond awesome. The classic feel of a classy barbershop with a modern twist is all included with your cut, on top of having good conversation with an all around great guy. With signed pictures from greats like Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett, you gotta believe the barber talent in this place is amazing.   So pretty much, get a haircut from this place fellas. You&#39;ll never regret it. The barbers work with your hair, and leave you with a dope look. Don&#39;t believe me? Come find me and peep my hair. The work speaks for itself.  
                  First time here and loved the hair cut from Andre. My wife feels that I look much younger with my new hair style. Definitely coming back to this upscale barber shop.  
                  Crewners is BY FAR the BEST place I have ever been to get my hair cut! Dan is the one I schedule all my appointments with and he is amazing! He is very friendly and really makes the whole experience an enjoyable one. not to mention after the hair cut your hair will look fantastic! I would highly recommend this business to my friends and family!  
                  Worth every dime, and then some.    For me, one of the most difficult parts of moving some place new is finding someone reliable to cut my hair the way I like it.  When I first moved to the Bay Area I tried several different barbers, all unable to cut my hair the way I like it done.  By chance I happened across Crewner&#39;s in San Pedro Square one day, and decided to give it a shot. After one cut with Dan where he was able to easily translate what I was looking for into a real quality haircut and experience I was extremely impressed.    Dan delivers top notch customer service consistently every time I show up for a haircut or just for a trim.  I&#39;ve been going to Crewner&#39;s for almost 3 years now, and wouldn&#39;t dare try to get my haircut anywhere else in San Jose.  This place is the best!  
                  My first experience with Dan was exceptional. I came here after reading the reviews and wasn&#39;t disappointed. The location is a pretty great place to wait if you get there early as the market area has about a half dozen little eatery places and lots of open seating. I showed up right on time and dan was ready to go.   Typically I&#39;d rather not make small talk and just get in and out. However dan was extremely relaxed and relatable and we quickly found some common interests. Before I knew it he was done. It was extremely fast in a good way.  I was in and out in 15 minutes but he never seemed rushed in the least, just very efficient.  He gave me some good advice on product to use and offered a couple times to give me a quick touch up if in ever in the area.   He also mentioned that he&#39;s opening 4 new locations. One near the new apple campus, one in or near Santana row and a couple other locations I don&#39;t recall.  
                  Best quote to describe this place:  &#34;There are only two people in the world that can touch my hair. Dan and myself&#34; - me.
