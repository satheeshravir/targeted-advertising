                  I was recently at the market for dinner and decided to try On A Roll.  I had the coconut curry chicken.  It comes with rice which I did not get since I am try to eat carb free.  The curry has a great curry flavor, a little spice but not too much.  Lots of good veggies (carrots, onions, broccoli, and more), lots of pieces of chicken. It was quite a big portion.    They seem to specialize in Vietnamese sandwiches which looked good.  Plus, they have some other Asian plate options. Definitely a good spot to try if you are looking for a nice Asian dish.  Curry is great, lots of sandwich options.  
                  On A Roll was located in a mini market area full of other food places. I was craving some Asian food since I was away from home for work. I ordered their fried chicken plate. It came out within 10 minutes. They also have complimentary cold jasmine green tea for you!   When my food came out, it was a huge plate. I received the fried rice, fried chicken, and salad. Salad wasn&#39;t too great, but everything else was delicious! I&#39;d love to try the other shops around as well.  
                  Grilled pork banh mi: Pretty good. Crunchy, warm, spicy, and relatively large. Meat was juicy. Spring rolls: (Shrimp + chicken) meh. Chicken was kinda dry. Not memorable. Taro milk tea: Tasted pretty good, but was mostly ice.  
                  I&#39;ve been here about 5-6 times over the past week. I&#39;ve had a variety of their entrees, appetizers, and drinks; all of which are delicious and reasonably priced. Service is quick and few seats are available nearby. Keep in mind though that San Pedro square has many seats available. My favorite combo is the beef banh mi and the Thai tea!  
                  I had pork noodles and vietnamese coffee. I had tried many vietnamese places, but this place was not impressive. Pork itself was good, but noodles were not good.  Coffee was good but not great. Considering very competitive area for Vietnamese (it&#39;s San Jose) I think this place can&#39;t survive.  
                  $6.50 for a pork banh mi sandwich. I suppose it&#39;s not incredibly high for a San Pedro Market dinner, but normally paying $4.00 for a banh mi is what I&#39;m used to!  The service was fine - nothing special and it was pretty quick to get my sandwich. Good balance between ingredients and bread, but I felt the bread was not of best quality.   I&#39;d probably come back here again if I really wanted some Vietnamese food to check out the other dishes!  
                  Grilled pork sandwich (banh mi thit nuong), no cilantro is currently $7.45 after tax.  It&#39;s pricier than your typical Little Saigon banh mi shop, but is larger than average (~9&#34;) and comes with the usual pork, pickled carrot &amp; radish, cucumber spear, mayo, jalapenos (and cilantro for the non-soapy crowd).  Bread seemed toasted, but did not have the crackle-y crust I like. The pork was moist and a little gristly in spots. The marinade had some crushed red peppers adding a mild heat that is different than most. Nice crunch and acidity from the pickled veggies.  3.5 stars and rounding down for value vs. other near-by banh mi spots.  
                  My ma caught a cold, so the closest place to get soup was here....and here&#39;s my take: I don&#39;t usually do corporate but when I do it&#39;s when I receive gift cards, free pizookie coupons, and happy hour. Here&#39;s how my experience went:  Ambiance Parking | Plenty of parking whether it&#39;s street or garage. We came here on a Tuesday evening for Surf City nights at around 6pm. We didn&#39;t have any problems at the garage 2 streets over 2 dollars for 2 hours? I&#39;m down with that.  Seating | Plenty of seating outside and inside however it does get pretty packed. The tall seats are on a first come first serve basis though.  Feels | In the heart of Huntington Beach Main Street. Coming here during Surf City nights is an additional plus. Feel free to watch a game or even people watch. It&#39;s a nice place for almost any type of night.  Food: Wonton Egg Noodle Soup (Recommend) * A medley of protein from sea to land, it&#39;s a very good fulfilling mix. For those cold weathers and in need of something warm.  Grilled Chicken Noodle Plate (A-OK) * Another good fulfilling plate. I just added more sriracha to spice things up.  Beef Tri-tip (A-OK) * Pretty good. The beef was cooked well and the vegetables mixed together makes it flavorful. Once again, it ain&#39;t a $50 steak but it gets the job done.  Customer Service: Came here on a Thursday lunch and they were fairly quick.  Overall: 3.5 Nothing amazing or must but it gets the job done. I can see how it&#39;s overpriced since it&#39;s the only Vietnamese place in San Pedro Market thus making it convenient ofr people in the area in the mood for Vietnamese or boba.   TL;DR Tips: * Seating is all San Pedro * Free water  
                  I only ordered some snacks from here, but I would definitely be back for a more substantial meal.  I came in on a Friday night and I ordered a thai tea with boba and an order of coconut shrimp.  Now, I freaking love coconut shrimp.  It is one of my favorite snacks ever, but it&#39;s really hard for me to find good coconut shrimp except in Hawaii.    Their thai tea was extremely delicious, although the boba had a slightly weird bumpy texture and it was a little too chewy.  But it was okay since the drink itself was somewhat large for $5.  The shrimps were $6 for 6 small pieces so I was a little disappointed since the portion weren&#39;t that big.  The breading wasn&#39;t as light and fluffy I wanted-- the breading was a little too heavy.  I don&#39;t quite remember what the sauce was, I think it was a sweet and sour sauce which I wasn&#39;t impressed by.  I think they should have used a mango chutney type of sauce instead. However, their sandwiches and noodles looked delicious, so whenever I&#39;m back in San Jose, I&#39;ll drop by and try something new.  The workers were polite and efficient, and it&#39;s a cafeteria style, so you pay and pick up your food.  
                  Time: 1:17pm/66°F sunny  Purpose: After getting a hot dog from Calidog it proves unsatisfactory. I&#39;ve couple more meet ups schedule for later in the day. So banh mi at all cost was the answer.  Ambiance: Also located inside SPS share space with other eateries. This place is the first place you&#39;ll see coming in from San Pedro side of street. Basically a stainless steel counter wrapped with sheets of faux bamboo stalks and 6-7 stools. Overhead hanging menu board as long as the counter itself mostly picture of item(s) taken up the space. Two door beverage fridge with sliding cold storage box finish out the place. Counter with touch screen, menus, tip jar, utensil organizer, sleeves of cup,  4-cup beverage holder trays. Its really a take out place then to dine in. Most workers nearby brings it back to workplace.   Staff: 4-5 workers buzzing around getting peoples order confused. One worker looks if though it was his first day. Asking person next to him about touch screen on register. Shouldn&#39;t be training during lunch rush, but its what company wants. I dealt with cashier no problems just order, pay and wait. Peak lunch hour may cause a ruckus among workers themselves.  Cleanliness: Grade A, clean enough to be seated without wiping after someone has left. One worker checks the front counter area every 10 minutes or so. Santa Clara health inspection posted with (Pass).  Eats/Drinks: Grilled pork banh mi price $6.80 was average being in the area it is. First thing I notice was the the bread. Not just any kind of bread this was the most sought after for me. It&#39;s a little bigger than standard size the inside fluffy part of center wasn&#39;t pull out. Instead it was compressed push down more making way for more room to add fixings. Grilled pork had the much needed seasoning, rare for it not to. Sando was neither dry or soggy made just right. With pork meat soaking just the middle core without touching inner exterior made it a crunchy tasty sando without a mess. Quality wise really close to TL/Chinatown standards.   Main Features: Banh mi, rice plates, Vietnamese coffee.   Products/Services: Vietnamese coffee/mocha, apps, sandwich, special, combos, rice plate, noodle plate, noodle soup, salad, lunch/dinner plates. Desserts-longan, jelly, basil, mung bean chestnut, coconut milk, flavor tea. Find them on FB and Twitter. Online ordering available.   Punch Lines: Pleasing flavors, modest cost, occasional spotty service, seats are minimal, drool worth, always buzzing, budget watchers, imaginable toppings, kitschy decor, light bites, zippy service, best cheap eats around, can&#39;t go wrong, causal and delicious, worth the wait, industrial interior, kept its standards.  Tradeoffs: At near $7 for a sandwich in this area. Nearby workers would find it a deal. More convenient than to drive out of area just to get your banh mi fix on.   Final Thoughts: A good place to try Vietnamese food if you&#39;re in a hurry near the downtown area of SJ. Its not as authentic compare to other well known places, but you definitely get your banh mi cravings here. Prices are higher due to share space and overhead so, I&#39;ll cut some slack here. Hours to avoid if you&#39;re press for time is 11:45am-1:30pm Mon-Fri. All other times are ideal to dine in catching up with what you need to get done.  
                  With all the choices there is in San Pedro Square Market, I chose to go here cause I had that craving for some serious asian grub. Among the selections of food stalls  (which ranged from mexican, american and Mediterranean), On a Roll got what I wanted and they serve it huge which is a plus for me!  Typical none smiling crew they got. You tell them (in this case shout out while pointing) what you want and they tell you that it&#39;ll be done in a couple of minutes. I got the chicken salad which was huge. The meat to veggie ratio was decent for the price and tho I wanted to share my food, hubby is allergic to anything pickled or has vinaigrette (boo hoo) anyhoo.. more for me!  Free tea is nice!  
                  ********************* 1151 *********************       I rarely visit San Pedro Square area unless visiting SP2. This time we checked out On A Roll for a quick bite. seeing the line at 12:30 PM on a Monday, this was the busiest restaurant here.      The service was quick and efficient, the owner/cashier was very nice and attentive which I was surprised by a fast food place like this.      Serving authentic Vietnamese food, CHEAP EAT, generous portion and fast service for lunch. They serve fresh Appetizers, Sandwiches &amp; House Specials. The On A Roll is open for  Breakfast, Lunch &amp; Dinner. some of their popular dishes: Spring Rolls, Fried Tofu, Egg Rolls, Sandwiches, Salmon, Fried Rice, Korean BBQ, Chicken Wings, Grilled Pork &amp; Chops, Beef Tri-Tip, Noodles, Pho &amp; Noodle Soups  - Tri-tip beef salad - similar to &#34;shaking beef&#34; with bellpepper, onion, with mango, tomato, lettuce salad - a solid dish.  - Wonton edd noodle soup - with shrimp, imitation crab, BBQ pork, not bad at all for less than $8, a bowl that about my head size, seriously.       We&#39;ll be back.  
                  With so many places to eat in Downtown, On The Roll never tend to fail me. I love their wonton soup. It&#39;s conveniently right across my office. I wish they would provide delivery to neighboring office building. That would be super duper!!!  I would definitely avoid going there during rush hour (lunch-time). You can tell why people would rather wait in line. Well worth for them. I myself don&#39;t have the patience, therefore I would go after the rush hour and eat on their counter.   Service is superb.    Good job on the food and service!!  
                  This place is a great alternative to Dac Phuc, (though really, anything is a good alternative to Dac Phuc), although you are paying a *lot* more than you would at &#34;real&#34; Vietnamese places on Tully.  I got the grilled pork noodle plate (bun thit nuong), and after begrudgingly handing over $10.50, was pleasantly surprised to see that it came with prawns and an eggroll (though it wasn&#39;t sliced) as well.    Despite my cheap-ass moaning about the price, I can&#39;t deny that the pork, shrimp, and egg roll were all very well-made, which is the main reason that it&#39;s getting 4 stars instead of 3.  Additionally, I don&#39;t know what kind of crack they added into their fish sauce + chili garlic sauce blend, but it was the most delicious fish sauce I&#39;ve had in a long time.    Anyway, I&#39;ll probably be back to try an egregiously high-priced banh mi ($5.95), but knowing that I can get almost the same for a couple bucks less every time will probably keep me from coming back.  
                  Wonton soup. Delicious.  A perfect lunch on long day. I enjoy eating this often. Shrimp, crab, and noodles cooked to perfection.  
                  I freakin love my banh mi&#39;s and this place makes one of the best banh mi&#39;s I&#39;ve ever tasted.  The bread that they use is so flaky and soft and the sandwich is actually served to you warm because they cook the sandwich fillings the spot. This is refreshing since most Viet places have the filling precooked a they just assemble and toast the bun.  Ordered the tofu sandwich and it was delicious. They don&#39;t skimp on the tofu and the pickled veggies. The picture I took is not filtered and it looks THAT yummy in real life ;) They&#39;re also pretty generous with the spread (butter?) that they put in the banh mi so if you like your sandwiches not on the soggier end of the spectrum, order it on the side or tell them less spread.  6$ for a banh mi seems steep compared to the other Viet places. Maybe they have to charge more cause they&#39;re in San Pedro and rent is higher? Definitely still a solid 4 stars for banh mi &amp; would def go back.  
                  On a Roll is a-okay.  Their food can be tasty and they have nice free iced tea.  Their vegetarian options are hearty and flavorful.  Generally the staff have been nice.  But there are also some things that are downsides to me.  Once, my friend ordered a veggie egg roll and ended up eating meat-- she&#39;s been vegetarian for years.  It&#39;s a miracle she didn&#39;t get really sick.  Another thing is that they don&#39;t peel the mangoes they put in their salads.  The shrimp salad, while delicious, had tough mango skin.  In addition to making the dish less enjoyable to eat, it&#39;s also somewhat concerning because some people can have allergic reactions to mango skin if they&#39;re very sensitive to things like poison oak.  I didn&#39;t, but I know it&#39;s a possibility.  On a Roll is not bad.  It&#39;s fairly good.  But...I have to say there are other Vietnamese places I prefer in SJ.  
                  My boyfriend and I used to love getting their banh mis here but the meat portions are small! You would expect a little more meat here since their banh mis are a tid bit on the expensive end- $6-8.  On A Roll, please give us more protein in our sandwiches for us powerlifters!  
                  Of ALLLLLL the places in SPSM, for my first dining experience, I chose On A Roll.  My boyfriend and I shared the spring rolls and the chicken Pad Thai.  The lady (probably the owner) took our order and was very helpful and polite.  Our food came out rather quickly and was soooooooo delicious. The helping of Pad Thai was so big, the 2 of us couldn&#39;t even finish it.  We got to take it home and shared it again for lunch the next day.    I would DEFINITELY recommend the chicken Pad Thai from this place... it comes with lots of chicken and also tofu.  (love the combination)  I really enjoyed sitting at the counter at On A Roll to eat our meal.  I feel like our plate was a huge advertisement too... people walking by were drooling, haha, just like we were when we walked up and saw a lady eating the same dish.  Definitely check this place out.  
                  I loved the customer service when I visited! I got a Vietnamese mocha which was a little sweet for my taste, and the lady at the front was happy to accommodate for me.  
                  Can only comment on vegetarian items from here but overall they are consistently good and fresh. Today something was off though on my tofu sandwich, that is why it is only 3 stars. Something was clearly missing and I wasnt sure what.   As well, they no longer give you a side of Siracha, it is a packet which is meager at best. It seems wasteful and more expensive to give out packets than just giving you a side.   The fried tofu is amazing. Always fresh and a ton of it for not very much money. Their portions are good sized and things are reasonably priced.  
                  Absolutely love this place. I order the veggie spring rolls every time and am always perfectly satisfied. My boyfriend has tried most of the other plates and the wonton noodle soups. All dishes are extremely flavorful and made fresh.   If hanging out at San Pedro, this is a MUST!  
                  Their food is pretty good BUT it&#39;s a little overpriced! $6 for a sandwich?! No thank you, you can get that for $3 at Lee&#39;s. Their rice plates are pretty good though, you can eat half and take the other half for dinner.  I was excited that they have a menu for milk tea. I tried one and it is awful, tastes like extra sweet milk and no tea taste what so ever. You would be better off walk an extra 10 mins and go near SJSU for some legit milk tea.  
                  I come here about once a week sometimes up to 3 times a week for lunch.  Generally I don&#39;t have to wait too long to get my food, and like many of the spots in the market seating can be an adventure.  My favorites here are: Coconut Curry Chicken. Comes with plenty of vegetables, and generally a decent amount of spiciness to flavor ratio.  This is my go to dish if I&#39;m not jonesing for anything in particular.  TriTip sandwich with no Jalos:  Generally all their sandwiches comes with Jalpenos, and they&#39;re strong for me.  I can get through half a sandwich before the burn is all I taste.  So I started ordering their sandwiches without them.  Very tasty, the tritip is also served with juices / sauce so you can dip your sandwich into it which is awesome.  
                  This review is long due. The establishment is located in San Pedro&#39;s Square Market and its the first one you will see when entering form the parking side. I am a regular and I have tried a lot of their dishes and frankly, I have never been disappointed. The couple that runs it are the nicest business owners and the food is always fresh and well seasoned. The owner will frequently say that he has just bought a super fresh salmon or other ingredients for that specific dish and I find it true. My current favorite is their salmon salad made with succulent juicy salmon marinated in tamarind sauce with spicy onions on a bed of lettuces. This is simple fresh and delicious food. You cannot go wrong here regardless of what you order. I recommend for people looking for healthy alternatives to their usual meals with a tangy kick. Sorry, no pictures this time as I devoured my meal before realizing I was about to write this review.  
                  Grilled pork sandwich (decent, a little fatty), good spring rolls, peanut (skippy) sauce was watery with what it looks like chips on top and a not so great almond pearl drink.  Came by later in afternoon, no line which was good.  Food came out in a bit, was tasty but was looking forward for a pearl drink and it tasted funny so only drank 1/8 of it before tossing it away.  
                  I had the BBQ pork Bahn mi. Good roll: crunchy on outside and soft in middle. The Bork was a bit wet, which made the roll soggy. The veggies and herbs were fresh and gave it a good heat. $6.50 is expensive for a Vietnamese sandwich but cheap for downtown SJ!  
                  In search of something light and healthy I strolled the market and fell upon On a Roll.    Spring rolls are hearty and were served with wonton crisps since I asked for my spring rolls sans shrimp.  The rolls are adequately priced; there were 10 pieces - about the price you&#39;d usually pay elsewhere.  I also ordered up their Grilled Chicken sandwich which was pretty good especially when paired with the Spring rolls.  The chicken sandwich was basically a vietnamese sandwich and seemed to me a little overpriced when you can go to another spot for half the price.  But the sandwich was still tasty nonetheless.  Be warned: there is mayo on the sandwich.  I wish I knew this beforehand since I am definitely not a fan of mayo.  Needless to say, I was a little irked and ripped off the part of the bread it was spread all over.  I&#39;ll likely be back just to try their vietnamese coffee.  I LOVES coffee, maybe that will bump On a Roll up some stars.  
                  I&#39;ve had only one thing here and it&#39;s their Honey Glazed Salmon. That is all I will ever  need ... it&#39;s the tastiest thing I have ever eaten at San Pedro Market Square. It&#39;s simply ambrosial!   Their honey glaze is simplistic yet amazingly flavorful. It has the right amount of sweetness, tartness, and saltiness. The salmon is always cooked perfectly and they place the right amount of honey glaze on top. The rice is a nice compliment to the dish. To top off this dish, they add a very delicious salad that has a wonderful mix of veggies and fruit (mango slivers!), which comes with a fish sauce based dressing that is simply devine! Altogether, I can tell you that it&#39;s pretty damn amazing.   The service is quick and professional. This dish never fails me!  
                  Amazing Vietnamese food. Delicious, fresh-seeming, great price.  First, delicious (right, first line is a list, strap in). The food here is good. Really good. Better than most Vietnamese food in San Jose good. The flavors just rise to that higher level. And I&#39;m vegan. As a vegan, I found the flavors fantastic. By the regular flow of non-vegans around me, I think I&#39;m not alone on that. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I enjoy my fair share of heavy-handed flavoring. This isn&#39;t that. This is finely-crafted, delicate flavor. And it is wonderful.  Everything (yes, we&#39;re on number two already) tasted fresh. Bouquets of herbs exploding fresh. Mint, basil, I don&#39;t know what else. The bread! Oh yes, the bread tasted like it was right out of the oven. It was actually flaky. Does anyone remember those Hotpocket (TM) commercials where, after being in a microwave sleeve they&#39;re supposed to come out flaky but it only actually worked in the commercial. This break is commercial-quality flaky and fresh. The tofu too, I&#39;m not sure I can call it flaky (thank goodness) but the texture is just unreal in the best way.   The price was great. I know, it&#39;s San Pedro-expensive and people will say that&#39;s too expensive for banh mi. Fine, fair. But it&#39;s great banh mi and great Vietnamese food in San Pedro Square where rent is exorbitant. I would never say high overhead itself is an excuse for high cost, but when the quality of food is this good the price is absolutely justified. Unless you want a McDonald&#39;s (TM) in SPS, appreciate the fact that local business owners take the time to bring their cuisine up to a level where they can afford these rents in the first place and appreciate the opportunity for such delicious food (at a cost still below some SPS neighbors) while having a good beer and listening to great music.   To the owner, Victor, thank you for taking a chance to bring your amazing food to our tables and stomachs!  
                  This place is awesome! I usually get the sandwiches, but have tried many dishes and have never been disappointed. The food taste fresh and has great flavor. Pad Thai is one of my favorite dishes, it&#39;s a large portion and could feed two. Nothing here has tasted greasy or heavy, which I like.  I frequent this place for lunch but also have had dinner here. If you ever need a boost in energy grab a Vietnamese coffee, I ask for pearls in my coffee, it beats Starbucks and is enough coffee for an entire day for me( I drink a lot of coffee). Service is friendly. I&#39;ve recommended this place and always hear good responses about this place.  
                  #20: veggie  noodle; a little too oily/greasy. Tofu was tasty &amp; veggies were good. Noodles just ok.  
                  I went to this place to order the &#34;grill chicken with shrimp and egg roll&#34; in San Pedro Square. The portion of the meal is really large and it&#39;s no wonder that it costs more than $10 per plate.  The grill chicken is tasty with smoky smell, so it is good. The shrimp is OK (nothing special) while my favorite part is the egg roll.  They provided free water/tea in the large jug on the side, so you could have a quick lunch on the side of the stall, but all the additional spicy sauce, fish sauce are pretty much self-service.  It&#39;s good on the overall for a quick lunch...  
                  This isn&#39;t the most authentic or best Viet food in town however, I totally pigged out on a huge plate of shrimp &amp; pork noodles.  I was even able to kill half of the big order of spring roles, which were pretty fresh and decent.  It&#39;s pricey here, but average for SPSM. I&#39;d come back for more!  
                  I&#39;m a huge fan of this place. In fact, when I dine out for lunch, this is is usually the place I frequent. The menu is diverse and delicious. It manages to meet any craving I have. Want something light? Try the spring rolls or shrimp/chicken salad. Looking for something hearty? BBQ Pork sandwich is to die for. Hungover? Wonton soup, my friend.   The quality and quantity of the food are spot on and the prices are very reasonable.  Much love for my peeps here!  [scarfing down the veggie noodle right now]  
                  The price/quality ratio is excellent - can never get tired of consuming the wonton soup and highly recommend the rib eye rice. The pad Thai was alright; it tasted more of Siracha sauce than actual pad Thai. The owners are very friendly and will remember what you order (and special preferences - make it extra spicy!) if you frequent it enough.  
                  There&#39;s like a ton of people working at this place. And by ton, I mean like seven people. And for a little food court-sized place, seven people is a lot. They were all like lined up in the little space in an assembly line-esque way.... uh, I guess the only value this comment has to you is that you can be rest assured service won&#39;t be slow!   Their menu was pretty basic. A list of plates around $10, a list of about 5 sandwiches for about $5, and some rolls. I got a grilled chicken sandwich. It was good! Fresh veggies, the chicken was decent, and it all felt pretty healthy. Usually those Vietnamese sandwich rolls are super annoying cause they crumble and leave a mess, but the roll here was manageable and softer than other places&#39; rolls.   At a lot of Vietnamese sandwich places I&#39;ve been to, they typically only take cash, but this place does indeed take card. Only complaint I have is Vietnamese sandwiches are usually super cheap--like $3, so I think $5 is a bit pricey for what it is. But whatever, fills me up and gives me the illusion that I&#39;m healthy yaaaa.  
                  Second time having this place during after work drinks. I had the grilled chicken on recommendation from the cashier. The banh  mi  was a bit more of an American fusion version than an authentic one but still good.  
                  I used to work just across the street from San Pedro Market and I missss this place so much!  I&#39;d eat here at least twice a week because it&#39;s pretty reasonably priced.  My go to items are the fresh spring rolls and the chicken ban mi.  (stomach is grumbling...drool)  The staff is so friendly too - family owned and operated :)  If you park in the big lot across the street you can get 2 hours validated by getting your ticket stamped at the bar in the back.  
                  This place has some phenomenal peanut sauce! The spring rolls here are totally worth it! They give you a whole plate full of them and it&#39;s pretty filling. Great portions for everything here.   I typically get the chicken + shrimp spring rolls, but you can pick between those meats apparently (or ask them for more options because their menu gives you no info). The rolls have a minty flavor to them that complements the peanut+sriracha sauce mixture really well. Honestly, it&#39;s hard to go wrong with spring rolls... :)   I&#39;ve also tried their sweet and sour chicken and rice plate (I believe thats what it&#39;s called on their special menu). It definitely was not what I expected... I got a plate of fried chicken covered in a layer of a delicious sweet sauce... and pineapple bits. I LOATHE getting pineapple in my food. If you&#39;re going to put an item like that on the menu, you should include a description so the customers are not unpleasantly surprised by their order...   Otherwise customer service is wonderful and I will definitely be back.  
                  $12.50 (+tax = $13.59) for Tri-tip &amp; Fried Rice to go.  The only reason why I gave 3 stars is because of the price. I&#39;d give 4 stars for the taste &amp; speed, but I think $12.50 is a little expensive for the meat portion. With more meat for the same price, 4 stars would be just right!  ------  Their food smells amazing (and tastes good too!). I originally went to San Pedro Square Market (SPSM) to try Konjoe Burger, but since On a Roll is the first vendor in SPSM, their delicious smell captivated me the moment I sent foot. The smell of their fried rice reminded me of the rice smell in a burger chain in Portugal (called Hamburgology) that I love, and I couldn&#39;t resist it.   I got the Tri-Tip &amp; Fried Rice with spicy sauce, and as I&#34;m eating it right now I am more than happy.   The meat is soft and chewey, cut in bite-size. They stir-fried some veggies too, including: celery, onions, green &amp; red bell pepper, and mushrooms. Ingredients all taste pretty fresh - crunchy, like how fresh veggies are supposed to be.   The fried rice is unfortunately white rice (I&#39;m not sure if they have a brown rice option), but it&#39;s not overly salty so I&#39;m satisfied. there&#39;s tiny bits of carrots, green peas, and corn. They could put more of those veggies to the rice, and use less rice to make it healthier.   While you&#39;re waiting for your food to be prepared, you can try their free cold tea! It looked like lemonade because of the yellow hue, but it tastes like normal, light tea. Not sweetened. Good free refreshment on a hot day like today :)  
                  First time in SPSM and On a Roll is right next to one of the entrances so I thought I&#39;d give it a try.  I&#39;ll have to explore the other spots on future visits.  I ordered the tofu banh mi and it was good.  I&#39;ve had better but this is a decent option and inexpensive compared to other spots.  Much better than a togo&#39;s sandwich and a fair amount of vegetarian options.  I would try it again.  I had no idea that the drink they had was iced tea; it was so dilutted I thought it was water.  
                  Since SPSM has a ton of options to choose from to satisfy the hunger in anyone, I was drawn into this spot by their honey chicken rice plate. For under 12 bucks, I got a fat ol&#39; plate of their honey glazed chicken, rice, and a salad. The chicken pieces were massive and perfectly coated in a sweet, yet tangy sauce and were super crunchy. The salad was also delicious and accompanied the meal perfectly. Overall, if you&#39;re craving some Asian while at SPSM then On A Roll is the place to go.  
                  I&#39;m discovering little restaurant niches such as this restaurant dye to my daughter, Joy frequently visiting the Marketplace.  I liked the Korean Barbque combination meal I ordered!  I&#39;ll return eating here soon!  
                  Surprisingly good seafood wonton noodle soup.  Good for a cold day!    We&#39;ll be back to try the rest of the items.  
                  Vietnamese fried rice plates... only with tri-tip?  Tasty but not very Vietnamese. Basically beef cubes, bell pepper, onions, and mushrooms, with some so-so fried rice.  The spring rolls (shrimp) were pretty tasty though, almost like 7/10ths scale ones, and then they give you 10 little pieces topped with crispy deep fried won ton skins. Not the fat delicious tasty spring roll of a traditional place, but good all the same.  Next time the seafood noodle soup looks far more interesting than the rest of the menu....  
                  This review is strictly on their spring rolls. They&#39;re the perfect bite size, and easy to share. They&#39;re super fresh, and seriously make you crave for more. I like the side of chips that they added, it complimented the rolls perfectly with the sauce. Definitely gotta try if you have the chance.  
                  This review is for the Chicken Salad $8.00  Yumm! I&#39;ve ate this twice and it has fresh veggies (roman lettuce, spinach, cucumbers, carrots,mint, and tomatoes)  with juicy peppered chicken. It comes with fish sauce as dressing.   I&#39;ll be back to try the spring rolls!  
                  Review for their spring rolls only. Super tasty! Filling and a good portion. Contains both shrimp and pork. Peanut sauce was uber creamy and delicious. Comes with a side of chips that went well with the sauce too. $5.50 per portion. One was enough to satisfy me when I wanted a light lunch. Perfect!  
                  Always love eating at this place! So many choices on their menu and they&#39;re all absolutely delicious!  
                  Dishcrawl 1 of 8: This was one of ten restaurants during Dishwalk and we were able to hit up eight of them. They girl at the counter was a little flustered with the influx of people at one time but they were putting the food out as fresh as possible. Banh mi was really good. The ingredients were fresh and the bread was moist with crispy edges that had a really good bite that lovingly kicked you in the face. It was sided with a spring roll and a small fried roll. The sandwich was probably the best thing we had on the Dishwalk so we&#39;ll be back sometime to try something else.  
                  They offer fresh spring rolls with tofu which is not specified on the menu. I was really glad I asked for a veg version because they were totally worth it. They cut them up like sushi rolls which makes them fun to eat. I could make a meal out of these. The peanut sauce they come with is also very good. A bit over priced at $5.50.  The guy working at the counter seemed like he didn&#39;t want to be there, but answered my questions about what was veg.  
                  Honestly, not expecting much from this place. Out of all the vendors they always look so desperate at the counter. However, I gave it a shot and... liked it!  I ordered the Vegetarian Noodle and it was a nice portion and tasted pretty dang good.  Good: - tasted pretty good - looked very appetizing - pretty quick service  Bad: -slightly pricey. not sure if this is a symptom of being at SPSM or what but $10 Veggie Noodle plate with 2 egg rolls seems kind of on the high side.  
                  I&#39;ve ordered from On A Roll a few times now, and have been very pleased with their fresh, delicious Spring Rolls.  This ample and filling snack is served with a yummy, mild peanut sauce and a side of crispy won ton chips.  Last night, San Pedro Market was abuzz  with crowds of patrons.  I headed to On A Roll and ordered the Spring Rolls, of course, and then I decided to give their Coconut Curry Chicken with Rice a try.  Since it was a really busy night, I poured myself some lovely iced Jasmine Tea from their counter top urn, and sipped happily at it while I waited for my food order.  My meal was ready before I could get halfway through my tea.  That was pretty fast!  The Spring Rolls were as delectable as ever.  As for the Coconut Curry Chicken with Rice, it was delicious!  The chicken was very tender, the vegetables were perfectly crisp, and the sauce was, to my pallet, addicting.  I really like what I&#39;ve ordered so far from On A Roll, and am looking forward to giving their other offerings a try!  Good job, guys!  
                  Every time I eat Vietnamese food I feel it&#39;s a healthy choice for me. Whether fact or perception I am glad there is a good Vietnamese restaurant so nearby for lunch. $5 for a great chicken sandwich! How can I argue with that? They also have a nice coconut soda to go with the lunch. Dishes could be a little spicier but I know some don&#39;t like the spice. How about a choice between spicy and mild? I noticed a lot of young office people having lunch there. Spring is definitely in the air.  
                  I absolutely love this place. It is always great service, good food, cooked consistantly perfect. I have never had a bad meal there and I never will. Try their Crispy Chicken and rice with the Tamarind sauce. So delicious!  
                  On A Roll&#39;s a decent option in San Pedro market. I ordered the coconut chicken fried rice and appreciated the mild sweetness of the coconut, which didn&#39;t overwhelm the dish. The chicken was tender, and there was a heap of veg including bell peppers and sugar snap peas (and strangely enough, celery); so that added some savory balance to the sweetness of the sauce. Overall, I enjoyed it.   Unfortunately, it took a long time for my food to be prepared. On a Roll had a few customers, but it was nowhere near packed. The owner said he was sorry it took as long as it did (15+ minutes for something like a food court is too long), which was kind, but my friends were done with their pizzas by the time I showed up to our table.  
                  This review is only for their banh mi, or as it is on the menu, grilled pork sandwich.  Just had lunch at the Market and the S.O. ordered a sandwich and I was able to get a couple bites of it. It is pretty average. It&#39;s good, but is it worth $5? Probably not. If I had to choose between getting this one $5 sandwich or 2 ($2.50) sandwiches from Dakao (link), I&#39;d have Dakao hands down. The S.O. thought the pork was decent, but I prefer the grilled pork flavor from Aroma Coffee and Snacks more. (link)  Might try this place again, but will pass on their sandwiches and see how their plates are. I think this place is more convenient for those who aren&#39;t used to venturing into the more ghetto (but delicious) hole in the wall vietnamese places off of tully or story road. lol amirite?  
                  The grilled chicken sandwich here is pretty good.  Last I checked, it was $5.50. The spring rolls here are also around $5 and are surprisingly  filling.  I used to frequent this place during my lunch break, and I still come whenever I&#39;m in the area and need a quick bite to eat.    Everything&#39;s made-to-order, and it comes out fairly quickly.  Taste bud approved!  
                  I absolutely loved my bbq pork banh mi, although the pork tasted more like slow cooked pulled pork than bbq I am used to.  The bread is excellent and I loved the abundance of pickled veggies.  It&#39;s not the cheapest Vietnamese sandwich place I&#39;ve ever been to, but it&#39;s delicious and it&#39;s $5.  LOVE San Pedro Square  
                  Awesome, Awesome &amp; Awesome sums it up..!  I&#39;m so Addicted to there &#34;WON TON SOUP&#34;  there&#39;s nothing Like it. It&#39;s all Homemade from Scratch.. It&#39;s NOT PRE-MADE either. &#34;It&#39;s not made till YOU order it.! There MENU is &#34;Off the Hook&#34;... If you come to San Jose to Visit or You already Live here. You gotta try it for Yourself..  Personally I would give it a (10 STAR RATING), it&#39;s just that good..  All there Food Dishes are.!  
                  I was skeptical about this place at first since they took forever to open, but after trying the food, I am a fan. Haven&#39;t had anything bad yet. The spring rolls, the crispy chicken, the wings... It was all good. Can&#39;t wait to try the other menu items.  
                  First timer.  Needed a quick bite for lunch.  Ordered the Grilled Pork (Vietnamese) Sandwich.  The bread was soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside.  The veggies were nice and fresh.  The marinated grilled pork was tasty.  They also have complimentary iced tea (instead of ice water) which was nice.  I will definitely be coming back, if I&#39;m in the SJ downtown area again.  Aside from that, the location is nice especially on a nice sunny day like today.  
                  I can&#39;t say much about this place since I only got an order of eggrolls as a snack, but they were solid! They use a different type of sauce, which includes tamarind &amp; honey, and I liked that too!  
                  I am a fan of this little place inside the San Pedro Market.  I always get the veggie sandwich from them and its fresh and affordable.  It looks like a family run business and I keep this place for my Tuesday&#39;s and Friday&#39;s lunch for a Veggie sandwich!  They do have other mouth watering dishes but I need something quick and good taste and they do that part right!  
                  The BEST won-ton soup I have ever had in the entire world!!! I can&#39;t go a day without craving their famous, hearty, huge bowl of delicious won-ton soup. Their beef dishes are to die for to along with their spring rolls! Everything is made from scratch and tastes so fresh and yummy. I only come to the San Pedro Square Market to eat here and the owner Victor and his wife Chi are really nice people. They always serve you with a smile and are very personable. They even have this complimentary tasty green tea at the counter for you to drink. Do stop at On a Roll if you are in town for business, pleasure or just want a great, filling meal!  
                  BBQ chicken sandwich for life. Seriously. It is that good. So good. I don&#39;t know what else to say. I&#39;d be craving their sandwich for days and would come here two days in a row for lunch (that&#39;s if my friends don&#39;t complain and drag me elsewhere). haha  
                  Not what I was expecting at all.  Granted I wasn&#39;t too hungry but you know a good sanchwich when you have one.  I am always up to experiment with new food joints in downtown San Jose and a Vietnamese Sandwich sounded good at the time.  I had my first Vietnamese Sandwich when I was at Cal State HAYWARD and it was just delicious.  (Not sure if the taste was directly related to my starving student status or if it was really THAT delicious! lol) This one on the other hand was far from delicious.  The wait was pretty long just like other yelpers have mentioned, and the staff is not friendly at all.  I am glad I ordered my sandwich with no mayo and the &#34;grilled chicken&#34; was bland, no flavor AT ALL.  I only ate half and i basically took all the chicken out and had the sandwich &#34;veggie&#34; style.  With so many options in downtown san jose, they really gotta step up their game if they want to stay in business.  Yes, they might still get customers because they are at the San Pedro Square Market but that rush will only last between noon and 2 at the most and I doubt that can keep them in business for long.  In the mean time my friend and I will continue our search for the perfect Vietnamese Sandwich. ;)  
                  I eat here enough. I figured i would give them props. Try the tri-tip stir fry. The chicken curry is decent.  
                  There is something fresh, simple, and straightforward about this place.  Their spring rolls are deliciously fresh and perfect.  Their mini egg rolls are fun and stuffed with hot meat.  I love for fresh, clean vietnamese food.  Great plates and banh mi.  And Dishcrawl approved. :)  
                  There are a few things to note prior to coming to On A Roll  1. It is not in a Vietnamese based plaza - taste will be catered to American standards (That being said - it is not authentic Vietnamese food.  So please don&#39;t trash it just because you&#39;ve had better Vietnamese food.)  2. $5 sandwich is a lot, but you&#39;re paying for the convenience of it being in San Pedro Market Square (If you compare it to paying for a hamburger vs a Vietnamese sandwich, you&#39;ll find you&#39;ll still get more out of the sandwich than the burger you paid upwards of 10 bucks for.)  I had their Chicken Banh Mi and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The chicken was juicy (mixture of white and dark meat) with the perfect amount of daikon/carrots, cucumber and jalapeno.  Expectations were quite low since I didn&#39;t expect stellar Vietnamese cuisine, but it was actually really good for a quick and cheap bite.  
                  This restaurant is on a roll.   I tried this place after surveying all the other eateries such as the Pho place that is in the other building and due to me wanting to eat something Asian.  And of course, this place is Asian.  The grilled chicken noodle plate was good, just not great nor perfect.  Some of the chicken was not cooked enough.  It seems that the cook is rushing things.  Not when there is only one or two folks patronizing this place at around 4 PM on a Saturday afternoon.  Surely the cook can spend a few more moments longer so it would be even more enjoyable and certained cooked all around.  Yes, it is very pricey.  But then, it is in the middle of Downtown San Jose.  And it is one of the places inside the recently opened San Pedro Square Market.  I would certainly return to this place someday soon to try one of their Vietnamese Sandwiches.  
                  Always a great meal, always fresh, always large hot portions. I&#39;ve eaten here at least 2 dozen times and never disappointed. This is the best place to eat in the Market Place Downtown San Jose. Could be the best Vietnamese Food in town.  
                  I would give it a 3.5 stars, but will round up. There wasn&#39;t much of a line there, unlike the other vendors, but I was in town one day and wanted to try it.   I&#39;m a big fan of Banh Mi, so I would say this would rank up there in the &#34;above average&#34; range. The bread was good, crispy and fresh.  The bread goes with well the amount of &#34;asian mayo&#34; that they used. I mean, it was good, but maybe a little too much for me.   The Grilled Chicken was the star for sure. Tasty without the mayo and they grilled it fresh which is nice. The daikon, cucumber and veggies inside the sandwhich are your standard fair.   I would suggest that the owners place a sample sandwich or something on their counter so people who enter SPSM can see what you guys cook. Samples are always good as well.   3.5 stars because of too much mayo and of course the higher than normal price for Bahn Mi.   Also, I would definitely go back if there was better customer service. Be more people friendly and smile. As i walked in there, everyone had a frowny face.. Doesn&#39;t sit well for first impressions.   Would i go back, probably, but after I try the rest of the diners over there.  
                  After an afternoon at the Renaissance Faire where we avoided the crappy food, we were famished and headed to SPSM for chow. Vietnamese sandwiches called to me so I had the barbecued pork sandwich.   Sandwich had generous portions of the barbecued pork along with strips of carrot, cucumber, cilantro and jalapeno garnishes. Bite into the sandwich for a flavor explosion with saltiness of the pork, sour jalapeno, nutty cilantro and fresh cucumber. Lunch partner had the grilled pork noodles that consisted of rice sticks, cilantro, carrot strips and bean sprouts for crunch. The grilled port was thinly sliced, tender and had a tasty combination of smokiness and sweetness from the marinade.  Prices are reasonable for the location although they don&#39;t look the most pretty of the food shops there but it&#39;s the flavor that counts!  
                  The veggie noodle dish and egg rolls are to die for! I love the veggie noodle dish over the meat ones because they have a generous offering of fresh bell peppers, broccoli, and tofu that are all made to order.  
                  Was walking around San Pedro Market and decided to give this place a shot.  It was small and cute so I wanted to support what looks like a mom &amp; pop shop.  Ordered the grilled pork sammie and I must say it was quite tasty.  The meat was well spiced and had a nice grilled taste.  The veggies were fresh and the jalapenos had just enough kick.  I only wish that the bread was a bit more toasted.  I&#39;ll def be back to try the other dishes.   Def worth giving them a try especially based on the prices.  I hope this place lasts.  
                  I give it an A-OK BUT   BBQ pork sandwich, needs more jalapeños...by more I mean more than one piece.  Also got the spring rolls, which were good. But they put shrimp laying on top of them, and the shrimp still had veins in them and one still had its feet (or whatever it is), so I passed. My husband ate one and was not thrilled.  Pleasantly surprised with the Vietnamese iced coffee! too much ice, but the drink tastes great.   It was their second day being opened, so I&#39;m sure they just have a few tweaks to made here and there. I have hope for you On a Roll!  
                  I&#39;m always on a quest to find a great Vietnamese sandwich. So as soon as I walked by, I knew exactly what I was getting. BBQ pork sandwich please! This is one of the fastest place in the market by a long shot. In just five minutes I was savoring a sandwich with soft French bread, a fair portion of meat, and the usual tasty toppings. A solid deal for just $5.  
                  I like this place a lot. I know it may not be the most authentic Vietnamese food, but it&#39;s delicious and healthy. This is one of our favorite places to eat in the San Pedro Square Market.  Everything is just really tasty. The spring rolls are great - and huge. Each one comes with 10 pieces. The peanut sauce it comes with is very good. The chicken noodle plate is also fantastic. And it comes with two egg rolls, which is sweet! The side salad on the plate is always fresh and has a great light dressing on it.   The staff are also really friendly. I&#39;ve been three or four times, and they recognize me now. The wait time is never that long - usually around 10-15 minutes max but sometimes less than five.  
                  I looove the bbq pork vietnamese sandwiches here.  I go here all the time, the food is high quality and fresh, and the staff is very friendly.  And of course the atmosphere at san pedro market is very cool  
                  Good stuff, ready to eat quickly.  I hav the seafood soup, chicken sandwich and fresh spring rolls.
