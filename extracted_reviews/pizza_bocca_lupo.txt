                  For some reason, I really, really like this place. I&#39;m usually not a fan to pay around $14-$18 for a fairly personal sized (they&#39;re more generous than a personal pizza you&#39;d find at majority of other places) but this place really makes their pizza perfectly.   I have been here a total of 3 times, where I&#39;ve had the pleasure of indulging in the Patrizio (assorted meats) twice, and one of their specialties once. Each time the pizza is perfectly cooked and I don&#39;t know how else to explain it. The crust is thin without being too thin, the sauce and cheese is a thick blend, and they&#39;re generous and balanced with the toppings. Never over or under cooked. I believe they use a wood-fire oven but I&#39;ll have to take a closer look next time.   Easily my favorite spot in San Pedro Square, this place has become one of my go-to&#39;s if I&#39;m in the mood for some food pizza.  
                  3.5/4  The pizza is located inside San Pedro Market Square.  I ordered the Patrizio pizza.(~$13) The description of the meaty pizza sounded really good but in the end the execution was not to my expectation.  The prosciutto ended up muted due to the heavy garlic and salted pepperoni. The cheese was not the melty stringy consistency I was looking for. The crust however seemed well done. Not too crunchy and not to doughy.  Coming back and getting a simpler pizza such as the famous margherita.  
                  The crust and base was chewy yet not soggy; pretty good attempt at an authentic wood-fired Neapolitan pizza. I also liked that the crust wasn&#39;t overly burnt and it didn&#39;t make your fingers black like some Neapolitan pizzas do. The dough actually held up so well that I was able to fold the pizza in half without everything falling apart. They were also very generous with the ingredients, all of which tasted very fresh. The order took about 15 minutes, so there was definitely time to walk around and get a seat. They also had some interesting wines and beers on the menu to pair with the pizza (for the ultimate experience).   Plus validated parking for two hours, which was a great bonus!  
                  I am updating my review because they reached out to me after reading my review. This shows that they really care about customer service and their brand. Not only did they reach out to me to apologize but they also gave me a refund and gift card to give them another chance. I appreciate that they made the effort to correct this and make me a satisfied customer. I&#39;m glad that they did this because my friends were pretty happy with their pizzas, and I wanted to experience the same kind of joy. Now, I have a reason to go back and give it another shot!   I am also looking forward to the improvements they will make to their gluten free crust. If they can perfect that, it will be life changing for them and their gluten free customers.   Thank you for making the extra effort to reach out to your customers and making sure we are satisfied. It says a lot about your business and values. Not many establishments would go the extra step to correct a situation like you did. Thank you!  
                  This place appeals to me more than the other restaurants at San Pedro Square Market.  So much goodness comes out from the little kitchen space they work in.  And they work so fast!  Their crust, fresh ingredients, their price and quickness for quality pizza is the reason why I keep coming back.   My usuals were the simple Margherita and the Bianca, which I refer to as an arugula salad on crust. But now my go-to pizza is the Rustica with extra basil.  With four dollops of mozzarella, pesto, olives, basil, and pepperoni on a wood-fire baked thin crust...this is the kind of pie that I automatically think of when I know i&#39;m going to be near SPSM. Try to make it out before an event at SAP Center.  For the price and taste, you won&#39;t regret it!  Now when&#39;s my next Sharks game?!!!  
                  Glad to know the SJ downtown area is growing and San Pedro Square seems to be thriving as well.   One my business associates recommended Pizza Bocca Lupo so we got the Bianca and the meaty Patrizio. Each personalized pizza is roughly 9&#34; in diameter. We also got the insalata with arugula, sliced pear and gorgonzola.  I really enjoyed the Bianca pizza. The tasty pizza dough is cooked in a fire brick oven layered with a bed of fresh arugula with slices of prosciutto drizzled with balsamic and olive oil. Really light and tasty which was a perfect lunch meal.  I wish I can come to San Pedro Square more often but it&#39;s a bit of a drive from my work. Nevertheless, I would definitely return for the Bianca.  
                  Our go to place in the Market used to be the taco stand, but recently we&#39;ve been hooked on the pizza here. We always order the meat pizza, add onions/peppers, and it&#39;s perfect for the two of us. There can sometimes be quite a wait, so make sure you get your order in right when you arrive (don&#39;t wait to find a table).   I think this pizza is top notch - I would highly recommend it!  
                  I sleepily ordered a pizza from Pizza Bocca Lupo and my taste buds woke me up.  Wow, so much better than the run of the mill pizza I usually get.  The owner was there so I chatted with him.  An interesting story, he learned the trade by working his vacation time for some years in an Italian pizzeria on the harbor, you can see the photo of the harbor on the wall.  He imported a genuine wood fired oven from Italy and all the ingrediants are the best of Italy.  If you want to know why Italians like their Pizza, try one of these.  If you are with friends, there is unbeatable pasta and a bar a few steps a way.  For the price, this is as good as it gets.  
                  I haven&#39;t tasted the gamut, but so far I can say with some certainty that Bocca Lupo is the best option in the dining smorgasbord that is San Pedro Square Market. It&#39;s done enough that, combined with A Slice of New York&#39;s Big Apple-style slices, I haven&#39;t really found a need to venture out in search of South Bay pizza establishments.  Bocca Lupo specializes in my favorite (or second-favorite, depending on how I&#39;m feeling that day about a New York slice) type of pizza, the Neapolitan. It&#39;s not quite as good as some of my favorites--Eataly in particular, Motorino in New York, Pizaro&#39;s in Houston--but their price point is certainly appealing.  Bocca Lupo does it pretty good, getting a pie to your table lickety split as Neapolitan style is apt to-do. It&#39;s hard to stray from the entry level margherita, my Neapolitan go-to. Their sauce uses San Marzano tomatoes (yay!) but is slightly on the salty side. Make sure to ask for extra basil, gratis.  
                  Pizza Bocca Lupo is a great lunch choice in San Pedro Market! This lovely marketplace&#39;s only weakness is its high prices, but Bocca Lupo got a lunch special for less than $10, which you get a half of a personal Neapolitan pizza and a small serving of arugula salad. The best part is that the delicious pizza is freshly-made and oven-baked right after your order! It&#39;s a deal that is really hard to beat especially in this area, so if you are having trouble deciding what to eat in San Pedro Market, choose this!  
                  Pizza Bocca Lupo is another great food stall in the San Pedro Square market. During the weekdays, they have a great lunch special where you can get a half pizza with a side of salad. However, on the weekends, they only serve whole pizzas.   Like almost everything in the San Pedro Square Market, all menu items are made to order and a pizza cooks in about 10-15 minutes. Another cool point is that it&#39;s cooked in a wood fired oven so the thin crust has a nice little char on the edges.   Pizzas we tried include the Joe&#39;s pizza with sausage and mushrooms and a daily special sausage pizza. One pie can either serve one or two people (depending on how hungry you are) and goes for about 13-15 bucks.  
                  You never could go wrong with pizza! This place is really good because it looks like they want you to experience more than just your average pepperoni pizza.   Got a pizza with artichoke, chicken, and olives, amazing! I love thin crust pizza and the crust alone is really good. Just a note: share! Because they&#39;re not by slices!  
                  I feel like the true test of any pizza place is the classic margherita pizza... so I came here on a sunny sunday afternoon and ordered it!   It was A-OK. The staff was friendly, the presentation was great (napkins to grip the edges to make sure you don&#39;t burn yourself), and it seemed very clean. The pizza was good, just good. Not the best pizza I&#39;ve ever had, and not the worst. For about $10.00 it was also a good quantity and pretty filling. If I&#39;m in the area, I might try one of their other options, but it&#39;s not worth a special trip over.  
                  THIN CRUST PIZZZZZAAAA!! That&#39;s one of my biggest weaknesses! And they make theirs so perfectly. I ordered the margherita pizza and the Joe&#39;s and both were yummy! I just wish they had more basil on the marg..they had like 4 leaves total. Other than that! They were big enough to share, my aunt and I could only finish one pizza so thankfully I love cold pizza because we had a whole extra one leftover! It&#39;s also great that they&#39;re located in such a central area (San Pedro Square Market) where you can also grab a beer or drink with your meal!  Prepare to wait when it gets busy though. I called in for pickup, came to pick it up 20 minutes later (when they told me I should come) and I still had to wait another 10 minutes after paying!  Definitely recommend the margherita!  
                  Pizza Bocca Lupo is inside the Market Place at San Pedro Square. This isn&#39;t some  average pizza, it&#39;s delectable brick-oven fired thin crust pizza. The size is smaller than a medium pizza, but usually more than one person can devour. It&#39;s the unique tasty flavor of the crust itself and it&#39;s crunchy bubbly undersurface crust that sets this place apart.  My favorites may not be yours, so I won&#39;t cover the extensive menu, except to say their salads are large and fresh.  If your friends want something different, no problem. At the Market there are many many quick &amp; casual restaurants (even an entire Treat Bot ice cream truck) and 2 bars plus a craft brew beer  bar with 100 choices, and they are all clustered under one roof, with plenty nonspecific open seating to choose from, indoors or out in the expansive patio area (with comfortable heaters at night). Can get crowded in the evenings as the weather warms up.  We eat pizza here monthly, and the staff is always upbeat and moving at warp speed. The whole scene has a great happening social  vibe. The place is filled with those fresh off of work or those waiting for the Sharks game.  Great place to hang out for a pizza and beer/wine and chat up the hours or watch sports on TV.  
                  Delicious freshly baked to order thin crust. I had Joe&#39;s which is packed with Italian sausage, mushrooms, and basil. Paired with one of their Italian beers, it was a great dinner.  Can&#39;t wait to come back another time.  
                  The bianca is a wonderful combination of salty from the prosciutto and cheese, refreshing from the arugula, and subtly tart from the balsamic vinegar. I strongly recommend the bianca, especially if you don&#39;t want a traditional tomato-based pizza. They slice the pizza into very large slices, and it&#39;s fun to slide out a thin slab and curl it up like a steaming sandwich to eat. Splitting one pizza among two people yields portions big enough to keep one comfortably satiated for a few hours--not too little, and not too heavy-feeling which is always a possibility with pizza.  
                  Food is still amazing, but needed to take off a star for their staff. I came here for lunch on a Friday afternoon and got the lunch special, super basic, run-of-the-mill margherita pizza. Collected my buzzer, and it still hadn&#39;t buzzed for 20 minutes, so I went in to ask about my order. The man I asked rudely told me that the wait time is at least 30 minutes and to come back later. EXCUSE ME? 30 minute wait time for half of a margherita pizza during LUNCH? Luckily my lunch breaks are super flexible, but it would have been nice knowing that I would have to wait 40 minutes for my pizza to come out (yep, it took 40 minutes...). Also, I&#39;ve come during dinner time on the weekends, when it&#39;s much more busy, and have still never waited that long.  Summary: Food is still good, staff is rude and extremely slow during lunch.  
                  Located inside the San Pedro Square Marketplace, Pizza Bocca Lupo (PBL) serves up authentic Neapolitan-style wood-fired pizza. PBL&#39;s restaurateur grew up making pizza in his native Naples and brought his dream of serving up authentic Neapolitan pie here to America with him. His dream was finally made a reality as, despite being open since 2011, PBL was recently certified (Jan &#39;15) as being truly authentic by the Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (AVPN). For those not familiar, the AVPN is a Naples-based organization that certifies Neapolitan Pizzerias as being truly authentic. They have high standards and certify every nuance that goes into making the perfect Neapolitan Pizza--from the type of flour (doppio zero FTW!); the oven temperature (900°F); type of tomatoes (San Marzano for Räv V!); and even the size (not more than 11&#34;). However, in my opinion, to truly pass the test you have to be able to make a kick-ass version of the Naples original: Pizza Margherita.  Toppings- A classic Margherita only has three toppings: Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Buffalo Mozzarella and Basil. There&#39;s something about the simplicity of those three but it really does make for the best pizza. PBL&#39;s toppings do not disappoint, as the they are top grade. The cheese is rich and flavorful; the basil is fresh and the EVOO adds a nice light finish. 5*  Sauce- Again simplicity is the key with Neapolitan sauce as it&#39;s usually just San Marzano Tomatoes, EVOO and salt. PBL&#39;s sauce has been hit-and-miss as one time it was rich and robust, and the other time it was watery and weak. 3*  Dough- I believe this is the most important part of the pie, as bread is to a sandwich. Unfortunately, once again, PBL is marred with issues of inconsistency. One visit the crust was perfect: chewy, robust and had the perfect amount of charring from the wood fire. My last visit the crust had good flavor, but no char and the middle section was undercooked and a gummy mess. Oven malfunction??? 3*  Service &amp; Ambiance- Service is minimal, but quick, friendly and efficient. San Pedro Sq is a much better venue and much more enjoyable for lunch than dinner/evening times, as it&#39;s a lot less hectic and crowded. 4*  Value- PBL&#39;s normal pizza prices are a bit high, but then again what isn&#39;t in San Pedro Sq?! However, they have terrific weekday lunchtime (11 a.m. - 2 p.m.) special of 1/2 Margherita and a salad for only $7.50! 3-5*  While being AVPN certified is a good thing and a hallmark that you&#39;ll be getting an authentic product made the right way with the right ingredients, it doesn&#39;t take into account the human factor that&#39;s impossible to quantify. With all that being said, I still like PBL very much and they are currently my favorite place to eat at in San Pedro Sq. I would love to give them a higher rating, but I&#39;d need to see more consistency from their product. But, as the saying goes, even when it&#39;s bad, it&#39;s still good. Buon appetito!  
                  For under $10 with tip I got a really spectacular pizza, the most wonderful service, and a pleasant place to soak up some free WifI for a few hours on a busy Friday.  Even during their lunch rush the pizza only took 10-12 minutes and everyone who worked here (especially the lovely Dutch woman at the register) was a stunning example of humanity... which isn&#39;t something I say about most people, but most people don&#39;t compliment me and then hand me a pizza.  I&#39;m a thin crust junky and this was a lovely European style thin crust with fresh ingredients and no bones about my wanting to add Kalamata olives.   I&#39;d initially wanted to stay away from pizza as I&#39;m trying to get in shape and eat healthier in general. I&#39;d planned on walking around San Pedro Square (which is a wonderful place but doesn&#39;t offer a whole lot in the way of healthy, unfortunately) and then hitting up the Friday farmers market just outside the square (def going back for Poke Bowl) but before I even turned the corner from the main dining area I saw a bunch of people with the most delicious and drop dead gorgeous looking pies sitting in front of them at practically every other table and I knew I wasn&#39;t going to make it much farther than Pizza Bocca Lupo.   No regrets.  My vegan pie was perfect and I didn&#39;t even miss the cheese. The guys who finish the pie off were mighty generous with the crushed red pepper flake containers (a hit with me) and though I generously opted to do a 3:1 split of the pie with my lunch-mate, I definitely wouldn&#39;t have had a problem polishing off a whole one (and then some on a good day) all by my self.   For sure my favorite food spot to date in SP2.  
                  Quick, fresh, but okay quality. Simple goodness. I don&#39;t recommend the caprese.   And the vibe of San Pedro market outside seating. Get a glass of red wine with your pizza (warning they only serve one type for glass).   Good place when you want to do something else in downtown. Almost a four, but eh. It doesn&#39;t go that extra mile (San Pedro in general).  
                  When SPSM first opened years ago, there wasn&#39;t the variety that they offer now. Back then &amp; to date there aren&#39;t many restaurants in SPSM that have wowed me with their food. So, when my husband &amp; I first came those years ago, PBL appealed to us &amp; we had to try their wood fired pizza. We instantly fell in love with the quality of pies coming out of PBL. The ingredients were fresh, they had a nice char on the crust, &amp; were piping hot fresh from the oven.   Fast forward a few years &amp; I&#39;m back to once again have some fantastic pizza. Menu still seems the same as it was which is fine. Why mess with a good thing? My group &amp; I tried a few different pies to have some variety. The Joe&#39;s: sausage, mushrooms, basil, fresh mozzarella, &amp; red sauce. Bianca: prosciutto, balsamic dressed arugula, &amp; mozzarella. Last, the Patrizio: pepperoni, prosciutto, garlic, red sauce, &amp; mozzarella. Of the three, the Bianca was my favorite because of the fresh arugula &amp; no red sauce.   What I&#39;m sad to report is that same pizza I fell in love with years ago has changed. Perhaps it was because we were there close to closing time &amp; the cook was in a hurry. Our pizza seemed just warm &amp; the dough was more on the soggy side. Not that piping hot crust that I once loved. I will say that the flavors &amp; freshness quality still remains at high standards. I truly hope that the quality isn&#39;t slipping because I enjoy the Neapolitan style pizza of PBL. I&#39;m definitely willing to give them another shot.  
                  One of my go-to&#39;s for Italian pizza! I love their Patrizio and Pizza Blanco. Definitely recommend eating the pizza on the spot so that it&#39;s hot and fresh; taking the pizzas to go or ordering delivery is definitely not the same.  On the weekends, they have some special breakfast pizzas with an egg! I can&#39;t remember the name of them but those are quite tasty too.  
                  MAN OH MAN AM I EXCITED FOR THIS REVIEW! Being a big pizza fan I was on the hunt for a go to spot in San Jose. Living in Willow Glen, I went down the list of local favorites; patxi&#39;s, jakes, the garret, bibos, pizza my heart?, mountain mikes?, round table?. Apparently, San Jose is in severe need of a pizza reboot if commercial places like Round Table are winning awards for best in valley. I mean come on! Round table is good and all but we must have more to offer and Bocca Lupo confirmed that we did.  The pizza options here left me weak in the knees. I was tempted to order multiple but alas, my thunder thighs begged for only one. I went with the Joes  (extra moz, mushroom, and sausage) and was highly pleased that choosing a favorite came so quickly. My friend went with the Tomasso and I will admit thinking he was crazy for choosing just sauce over all the other marvelous topping combos available. We came in during the lunch hour. Although there were plenty of pies around, there was no line and it took only 10-12 minutes for our  buzzers to vibrate. The pie was so delicious and I regretted opting for half a salad instead of a full pie. Ragrets. Any who, the moz was very fresh and oozy. The sausage reminds me more of salsicca as it isn&#39;t round pieces of meat but rather crumbly. And the sauce, oh man, the sauce explained why they have a pie with just sauce on it! It is flavorful, both tangy and tomato-ey. I definitely found my go to pizza spot!  Parking- They will provide you with a validated ticket with a purchase of $6 or more at the end of your transaction if you have parked at the lot directly beside SPM2. Just remember to bring your ticket down and to ask.  Seating- lots of seating even during lunch hour. I definitely recommend it for large groups and if you want to talk.  Ambience- It reminds me a lot of a cafeteria only grown up style as you can get alcoholic beverages from the bar. There are lots of places to eat from which is nice in case you have a non pizza eater with you (maybe reconsider this friendship).  
                  Came here last Saturday after a hike, and got the Margherita.  If you are a fan of crust, you will be faintly disappointed over the crust being slightly burnt...who knows, maybe it was just that one day with a different guy at the oven.  Other than the crust, I believe it&#39;s pretty good pizza.  *Good customer service *Toasty pizza crust *Excellent toppings  
                  First things first-- you can use your Paypal app to pay for your purchases here.  Nice and convenient if you haven&#39;t done so before.  All you have to do is sign into your Paypal account and swipe at the register.  It takes the money instantly out of your Paypal balance.    Here&#39;s what I ordered:  Joe&#39;s Special- Sausage, Mushroom, Extra Mozzarella, Parmigiano Regiano, Crushed Sun Marzano Tomato sauce, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  This thin crust pizza had some serious flavor with its sausage and only slightly tangy tomato sauce-- just the way I like it.    The pie is hand tossed to around 11&#34;- 12&#34; (depending on who&#39;s doing the tossing). And they only come in one size.  I&#39;m only taking one star off because I thought it was a tad pricey.  ($15.21).  But then again, everything at San Pedro Square is.  
                  Great service.  Fivestar was down the first two times I&#39;ve been here. Free water and yummy appetizers.  I&#39;ve tried the Insalata and Antipasti (Both $4.99). Great quick bites.  Definitely need to come to try the pizzas. They smelled heavenly!  
                  This pizza place is a great addition to the San Pedro Square.  I seem to be always meeting people here to go to either concerts or Sharks games before and after and this is a great spot to share a pizza.  I like that they have a vegan alternative with no cheese. Normally that can be disaster for most pizza places but they make it really good.  The crust is very chewy and they put enough tomato sauce that everything is very flavorful and not dry.  I&#39;m pretty picky pizza person because I more about the crust and sauce than the toppings.  I love the way they do the arugula on top of any pizza as they dress the lettuce like a salad and put it on after it comes out of the oven.  They also have a good lunch special where they make literally hand make half a pizza and a salad for $8 or so bucks.  Everyone I&#39;ve shared a pizza with is really happy with them, they get gobbled up quickly.  Really nice that you also can take the buzzer they give you and you can then go do other things like grab a beer while they make your pizza.  They also validate parking for 2 hours so a good deal all in all.  I will definitely keep coming back and it&#39;s one of my top places for delicious pizza.  
                  Super crowded spot, at least when we went for dinner in the evening. It took almost half an hour to get our pizza, which was decent enough. We ordered the pesto pizza this time around. While the toppings tasted very fresh actually, I found the pizza to be a bit on the boring side.   Part of the problem in my opinion was the lack of toppings and maybe that&#39;s my fault for not trying one of the meat pizzas. All in all it&#39;s a decent place to grab a pizza and some drinks for the price, but I still prefer my usual pizza joint to this one.  
                  If you&#39;re looking for a light and fresh pizza this is your place! Usually come here when I&#39;m tired of Costco pizza.  
                  My coworkers like to have lunch at San Pedro Market, leaving me with few satisfactory culinary options. I generally grab a pizza--it&#39;s generally innocuous, though anybody claiming to make pizza in the Neapolitan tradition must withstand the strictest rigor.   ***PIZZA MARGHERITA - Fior di Latte Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Crushed San Marzano Tomato Sauce, little Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil  I mean, it&#39;s okay. It has all the trappings of a traditional Margherita. Decently high quality mozzarella. San Marzano sauce. Fresh basil. Reasonably pliable crust. Then why oh why doesn&#39;t it satisfy me like the real deal does? It somehow tastes counterfeit, suspect. For starters, the flour used in the crust is slightly off. The tomato sauce is slightly too acidic, and lacks that natural sweetness.   I got the lunch special, which came with an unremarkable salad--arugula I believe, some pears, bleu cheese, a simple vinaigrette. Sounds like a winning combination, but for some reason it just didn&#39;t burst.   I don&#39;t know, the pizza was pretty good. But although some people like Marshmallow Mateys, I&#39;m a Lucky Charms kinda guy.  
                  One of the BEST Caprese Salads I&#39;ve had in a long time. There was almost a whole basket of grape tomatoes halved, large slices of Mozerella and huge basil leaves along with a great basalmic vinegar. It was Amazing.   I also ordered a Margarita Pizza. The dough was good, but there wasn&#39;t enough cheese or basil, otherwise it was tasty!  
                  Autopsied that a food court type pizza place makes tasty pizza. I ordered the Joes which included sausage, mozzarella, basil, mushroom and red sauce $13. It is a little bigger than a personal sized pizza. Cashier told me it would take 15 mins to make and have me a buzzer. The buzzer rang after 5 mins. The pizza crust was thin and the pizza itself was tasty. Very happy with my choice.  
                  Love this pizza place! I always come here when I eat at San Pedro Square. Haven&#39;t really tried too many of the food places since I normally end up going directly here. The pizzas are personal sizes and they are a bit pricy. It&#39;s definitely worth it though because you can tell they use quality ingredients. The crust is very thin. My personal favorite is the Joes pizza which has sausages, mushroom and mozzarella and optional basil.  
                  Tried the Capriaccosa today  with olive oil instead of red sauce. Pie was on point, all flavors melded well together.  Told Frank to give it love.  And other place was his usual long or short ribs from Viet place  
                  It was the best pizza I had for a while: pear, arugula and Gorgonzola on thin crust. All was done just right, the pear and  arugula barely cooked which was how I liked it done, juice running out as I sank my teeth and the size is perfect for one .  
                  Pizza is okay here. They stay open when the other food spots are closed at SPS and that&#39;s how they usually get my business, especially when I&#39;m hungry. Pizza isn&#39;t very flavorful (tomato sauce is bland) and I usually don&#39;t get pizza because of it.  
                  San Pedro Square is full of hidden culinary secrets. Pizza Bocca Lupo is one of them.   If you&#39;re a pizza fanatic, and you like yourself a thin crust, the pizza here is the way to go.   I&#39;ve been to San Pedro Square Market a dozen times, and I&#39;m slowly working my way around the eateries, and the pizza had been on my list for quite some time.   I finally decided to grab a pie on a night when I wasn&#39;t craving anything specific.   As advertised, the pies are super thin, nice and doughy and a little bit crispy/charred. The toppings are nice and light, you&#39;re not going to get anything heavy handed here, and it&#39;s definitely a good thing.   If thin crust for a pretty good price is your steezy ,Pizza Bocca Lupo is a must eat.  
                  Great oven thin crust pizza! This place is inside The Market in San Pedro Square. I usually come here during lunch and offers lunch specials from 11am-2pm (M-F). It&#39;s half pizza and half salad.  
                  Located inside of the san pedro square market which I absolutely love.   If you&#39;re drinking here (which I always am) this is an awesome place to grab a bite to eat. The pizza is made fresh so sometimes it can take awhile, but it&#39;s worth the wait.   I&#39;ve gotten pizza from here 5 times and every time the crust is cooked to perfection and the toppings are fresh. Cheese does not get all oily and gross like some other pizza places and for $15 you get enough to feed 2.   I recommend the margherita that is simple yet delicious. I didn&#39;t care too much for the spicy one I think it&#39;s called the diavlo or something like that the spicy sauce was more tangy than spicy it needed more heat.  
                  Great Location | Good Food $  First time eating at the San Pedro Central Market! VERY COOL. It was nice to see a bunch of options with a lot of locals. We ended up getting two pizzas from this place and an arugula salad. My husband and I agreed that the pizzas were delicious, but we differed on the salad. Nothing too special about the salad, but it was still a good addition to have to the high carb meal :P  **Pizza crust is very thin. I suggest two people can eat 1 whole pizza if they&#39;re not starving. Otherwise... you&#39;ll need to order another.  Parking garage was conveniently located across the street. We validated our parking ticket at one of the stations in the marketplace.  
                  I got the chicken pizza (wow, i sound basic) - but the cash register said it was one of the more popular pizzas!!   I came here after starving from hiking at castlerock all day so when it came time to eat, I ordered a full salad to myself (arugula - i like!), and contemplated NOT sharing the pizza with my friend.   The pizza wasn&#39;t too shabby, but a bit dry (here comes cotton mouth). I wish I asked for some extra tomato sauce on the side to dip in. I kept on asking myself if they had ranch or anything to make this less dry.   For now, it&#39;s A-OK. But I would like to try the pear gorgonzola pizza next! Was def eye-ing this.  
                  I have now had pizza here twice - The first time we ordered it to go and walked back over to our house. Even though we live close by, they were a bit oily/soggy by the time we got home. We thought it was good still but holy cow- such a huge difference! The pizza is delicious! The crispy crust with a nice little char is the tits and the flavors are great. We had the Patrizio &amp; Margherita - both were :) but I enjoyed the Patrizio more!  Try the pizza here- but make sure to eat it there! :)  
                  awesome pizza! made in their hot hot oven these pizzas come out fairly quickly and delicious. personal favorite is the bianca. topped with prosciutto and arugula drizzled with some olive oil and bam you got yourself a great pie!  
                  The only pizza joint located inside of San Pedro Square market. This place does awesome wood fire pizza. I love their rewards points program because it keeps me going back for more so I can get the free pizza at the end of the tunnel. I have definitely tried a couple of their pizza combinations on the menu, but the favorite is always the Joe&#39;s Special which has the sausage, mushrooms, crushed tomatoes, and basil. However, to make it hella epic, I always add pepperoni and pesto sauce drizzle. Everyone who has tried my creation has been on that hype and ask for their pizza like that as well. I also enjoy their garlic bread which is perfect to share. If you are overwhelmed by the food choices at SPSM, definitely pick Pizza Bocca Lupo.  
                  Super delicious. Super great atmosphere.  Visiting from SoCal. and now I wish there was one back home. Heading back for round two very soon.  
                  Paid with paypal and received $5 of the garlic flat bread. They have restaurant pagers, so you can wait anywhere until the order is ready.  They made it in less than 5 minutes, which seems awfully fast, but it tasted super fresh. It comes nicely cut into 12 pieces, so it was easy to share and dip into the marinara sauce.  
                  It&#39;s a good pizza joint to have inside San Pedro Square Market--because not many things go better with beer (and life in general) than pizza. The lady and I shared a Capricciosa (Mushrooms, Artichokes, Olives, Ham,...) and Insalata (Arugula w/Pear &amp; Gorgonzola) and consumed it on the tables next to Market Beer Co. The pizza was filling and flavorful and hit the spot, while the salad was just OK. They piled on the Arugula, which was nice, but then the Pear &amp; Gorgonzola to Arugula ratio was way off. The three slices of Pear and tiny handful of Gorg were eaten quickly, leaving us with a pile of naked Arugula (a touch more dressing would&#39;ve been perfect too). But I do appreciate the portions! The two of us were stuffed for just under $20, and that is a rarity these days.  
                  The pizza was AMAZING! Really really really good! The place is crowded and parking in the garage across the street is a pain, but the food was worth it!  San Pedro Market Square looks like a fun place too, next time I&#39;ll stick around to eat instead of taking it home.  
                  There is always a line at Pizza Bocca Lupo, and I like that you can watch them putting the pizzas into the wood fired oven. We decided to check them out while at San Pedro Square for dinner, and opted for the Bianca (Proscuitto, Arugula Tossed w/Balsamic Vinaigrette, Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, $13.99,  yelp.com/biz_photos/pizz… ), which I thought was just ok. The crust was good (crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside), but the toppings where boring. I would come back to try their other pizzas, but wouldn&#39;t order the Bianca again. It took about 10 minutes to get our pizza after we ordered, so it&#39;s pretty quick.  
                  On Saturday, 1/3/15, my girlfriend and I decided to hit up the San Pedro Square Market in Downtown San Jose for lunch. We ended up trying Pizza Bocca Lupo as our second spot.   Atmosphere/Decor:  Pizza Bocca Lupo is a very small place just like all of the other surrounding places to eat at inside of San Pedro Square Market. It&#39;s set up like a food court. You can either eat your food at the tables located in front of Pizza Bocca Lupo or get it to go. You can see the employees prepping pizzas and cooking them in the oven that was imported from Italy-Naples. There are plenty of tables and other areas throughout San Pedro Square Market where you can sit at and enjoy your food.   Food:  I read on Pizza Bocca Lupo&#39;s website that they use a hand-made brick oven imported from Naples to cook all of their pizzas. So technically one can say the pizza you get at Pizza Bocca Lupo is the same pizza you will get in Italy. We ordered the Joe&#39;s Special (Crushed Tomatoes, Mozzarella, Basil, Sausage, Mushrooms, Extra Mozzarella, and Extra Virgin Olive Oil. I had high hopes for this pizza place but it felt short in my opinion for so many reasons. First of all, if you have a pizza oven imported from Italy your pizza better be amazing and literally blow your socks off! This pizza didn&#39;t even come close to that! The sausage and mushrooms were off to me. The mushrooms tasted precooked. The texture of the mushrooms was very rubbery and chewy. Even the color of the mushrooms didn&#39;t look right. The sausage didn&#39;t taste like your typical Italian sausage. It reminded me of ground hamburger meat. Hamburger meat actually tastes good. Too bad the sausage didn&#39;t. The pizza dough/crust tasted really good. It had a nice char on it. The tomato sauce was on the thin and runny side but it still tasted good. The mozzarella cheese tasted good as well.    Service:  Jannelle, who worked the front register and took my order, was very nice. All of the staff members seemed nice. Our pizza was ready within a few minutes.   Overall:  I thought the pizza at Pizza Bocca Lupo was going to be great but it wasn&#39;t. It was just average at best. The mushrooms and sausage were supposed to be the star of the show on the Joe&#39;s Special but they didn&#39;t taste good. The pizza at Bocca Lupo is supposed to be the same pizza one would experience in Italy. If that is the case I&#39;m definitely not in a hurry to go try pizza in Italy because the pizza at Bocca Lupo was mediocre. Do yourself a favor and hit up Tony&#39;s Pizza Napoletana in SF on Stockton Street. It is literally hands down the best pizza you&#39;ll ever eat!  
                  My god... Pizza Bianca for breakfast, lunch, and dinner please!! So freaking good. It&#39;s the cheese, I seriously think it&#39;s the cheese.. And the arugula.. And the prosciutto.. And everything put together! Pizza is so good I can&#39;t form words or sentences..   I&#39;ve tried other pizzas here (barely) lol and they&#39;re good too. I just can&#39;t get enough of my Bianca.   $10 for a small pizza. It&#39;s literally cut into 4 kinda big pieces. It&#39;s good enough for 2 people to share or 1 really hungry person. If you have 3 not so hungry people you can ask them to cut smaller slices.  
                  Excellent pizza, friendly staff! One of the best pizzas I&#39;ve had in a long time!  I had been working in Pleasanton and just got off the bus before heading back home. May explain-wife and I had some pizza in Pleasanton the was simply the worst pizza I had ever had. Now I was craving a real pizza and was on a mission to find it. Mission well accomplished! The staff was friendly and professional. The pizza was off the charts good.  I live in the Morgan Hill area and there isn&#39;t a real pizza place to be found, a lot of copy and paste pizza joints with ingredients from a can.  Definitely will be returning anytime I am in the area. Thanks to the staff for the basil pizza recommendation!  It is located in the San Pedro Square Public Market, a very cool place with a great community dining room. I recommend checking it out.  
                  I&#39;m a firm believer in the idea that all pizza is good pizza, but Pizza Bocca Lupo is REALLY good pizza. Although we have so many options for delicious pizza out here, sometimes I still crave the thinner, less ... &#34;American&#34; pizza we ate all the time in Italy. Pizza Bocca Lupo did a pretty great job at creating that. It&#39;s the type of meal that fills you up without making you feel like you need to lay down after.  I got the simple Margherita pizza, but added garlic as the guy suggested. Mmmhmm. The pizza was a decent size, had it for lunch and saved a slice for a snack later in the day.   Also, you can use Paypal and the Fivestars program to make it more affordable, so that&#39;s always nice.  
                  Thank you for taking my comment seriously. The pizzas were fantastic yesterday.   Previous Post:  My kids love this place, but the last couple of times, the crusts were burnt. The kids noticed the fire was more intense than before. Like I said, they love this place and they watch how their pizzas are made every time.  Hopefully they can tame the fire the next time we go.  
                  Honestly great pizza, good ingredients, nice location in the San Pedro Square Market. Quick speed. The only thing is that a personal pizza is $10-$14. I feel for the size it is overpriced.  
                  It&#39;s another San Pedro Market place to try because it&#39;s so good.  They cook the pizzas in a brick oven in the traditional sense, so it leaves a nice char on the bottom of the crust.  The crust itself is thin, so it&#39;s a bit crunchier. The toppings are always good no matter what specific pizza you choose. I recommend Joe&#39;s Special or the Patrizio. Both are quite delicious. They always seem to have the perfect amount of sauce and cheese. I would say the only negative is that it&#39;s on the pricier side at $13-14 for a pizza equivalent to a medium-size.  
                  Pizza Bocca Lupo creates the best pies on the peninsula. Their mix of thin flavorful crust is topped with high-quality authentic ingredients and wood fired to perfection. The Neapolitan-style crust delights with just the right amount of crisp, chew and fire-kisses.   I&#39;m a northeast-raised foodie who has searched far and wide for great authentic pizza since arriving to the bay area. And Bocca Lupo pizzas are road-trip-worthy.   If the trial goes well, they will also sell pizza by the slice, which is a slightly different recipe than their pies but still delicious.  
                  Inside don Pedro Square. authentic Italian pizza, thin and crispy crust. Great sauce and good portions of toppings on the pizza. Inexpensive, good, and fast service.  Great find!  
                  Update: they no longer have gluten free pizza :( Great gf pizza. Tom&#39;s special and the Bianca are particularly good.  
                  In bocca al lupo! CREPI!!! I&#39;ve studied in Italy and the pizza I&#39;ve had here is the closest thing to a Neapolitan pizza I&#39;ve had in the states. It really brings a smile to my face and fond memories of the Italian country side.  The crust is thin and crispy and ingredients are fresh. I opt for the Bianca with its generous prosciutto and arugula. It gets 4 stars because the quality isn&#39;t consistent. In the recent months, the dough and crust has gone from authentically Italian(thin and crispy) to a lot more doughy and thick. I haven&#39;t been recently, so perhaps this has changed. I hope so!   Order your pizza, find a spot outside and pair it with a chianti from the wine bar across from pizza bocca lupo or farmers ale from the beer bar in San Pedro market square(building next door).  
                  I&#39;m a huge fan of San Pedro Square Market and I finally got to try the pizza here at Bocca Lupo. It was fantastic! Neapolitan style thin crust pizza cooked in a wood fired oven. They gave me a pager and I barely waited 12 minutes and it was a buzzin!    I chose one of the specials called the &#34;Rustica&#34;. It had salami, olives, mozzarella, and cherry tomatoes (which I subbed for mushrooms), and that was topped (after baking) with fresh basil and more fresh mozzarella. It was awesome! I was able to eat the whole thing myself but I was too stuffed afterwards. Your better off sharing this one but when it come to pizza, I have no self control...    I did see some folks walking away from the counter with half-pizzas... This may be the way to go.    I&#39;ll definitely be back!  
                  I&#39;d say this place serves up an average pizza.  Nothing to rave about, but it was decent.  I ordered the Margarita Pizza since it was the closest thing they had to a plain cheese pizza for my son.  Since my son just wanted cheese, I asked for the basil all on one side of the pizza for me.  Well, I love basil so I was looking forward to my side of the pizza.  Once we got it, I honestly have to say I was a bit disappointed.  Cheese was minimal for my son and so was the basil, despite having the entire pizza&#39;s worth of basil on one side.  However, I did love the pizza dough/crust.  This is an okay place - not great enough for me to stick to it the next time I&#39;m at the San Pedro Marketplace.  
                  This is my go-to place for pizza. Love this place.  
                  Interesting little pizza place, bustling almost all the time, probably as much for the location as the style of pizza, if your health food not you&#39;ll love this place but if you&#39;re a greasy pizza fan you probably won&#39;t, I like it only because it is original it taste pretty good but it wouldn&#39;t be someplace and I will probably go to all the time but it is pretty good and interesting to say the least  
                  Came here during lunch on a Sunday afternoon.   I got the pear gorgonzola pizza. It contains: pears, gargonzola, topped with arugula and olive oil. The thin crust pizza was crispy, but not too much. I&#39;m glad it wasn&#39;t burnt! Overall, the pizza was very delicious! Refreshing and healthy! Great for both vegetarians and carnivores.   The pizza came out pretty fast which was great because we were hungry!  There&#39;s a water dispensary if y&#39;all get thirsty. Self served so you don&#39;t gotta be a bugaboo.  
                  Thin crust means that you can eat double the pizza with no regrets.. Yep, DOUBLE THE PIZZA WITH NO REGRETS.  I ordered the margherita and diavola pizza and it was far from a disappointment.. The crust was so perfectly thin and the sauce was just the right amount!   The price is kinda pricey for the size but you&#39;ll definitely know where that money goes to with the first bite! The total of the two pizzas came out to about $25 and fed 4 people with 2 slices each person.  AND conveniently there&#39;s a bar right across the way.. BEER AND PIZZA?!?!? Sounds like a party to me.  
                  Delicious.   This thin crust Neapolitan style pizza is comprable to my favorite fancy pizza place in Providence, RI home of many people of Italian decent.   The price point is spot on and the ingredients are top notch. The crust has a nice char and the ratio between sauce, crust and cheese is perfect. Pizza like this tends to be a little soft in the middle from the cheese and sauce, but just embrace the warm, molten goodness.   The people who work here are nice to boot.  
                  I wish I could give this place more than an A-OK status rating but I just can&#39;t!  I am definitely more of a deep dish pizza fan but I&#39;m going to go ahead and pretend that&#39;s not the case and just give this place a super fair and honest review.  We ordered the Patrizio pizza pie which comes with Pepperoni, Prosciutto Cotto, Roasted Garlic, Oregano, Chili Flakes, Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Crushed San Marzano Tomato Sauce and Extra Virgin Olive Oil.   What suprised me most was how long it took our order to come out. I figure if you&#39;re making pizzas out of a wood fired oven, it should come out within 10 minutes or less. That was not the case.  To be fair though, the pizza was actually pretty tasty. The crust really had great chew to it. But another thing I didn&#39;t really appreciate was how little toppings there were on it. I like my toppings PACKED if I&#39;m about to eat a thin ass slice of pizza. Also, the pricing for the pizza was not satisfactory to me due to how hungry I was even after eating the pizza. We ain&#39;t in NY for you guys to charge NYC pricing on these pizzas!  
                  Lunch break &amp; San Pedro Sq we go. Thought this spot would curb the pizza craving. The size of the pizza wasn&#39;t the issue as it was plenty big and arguably enough to feed 2.  The taste left something to be desired. Preparation and the wood brick permeated through to the taste. Thumbs up there.  The toppings were fresh and of good quality but the crust overshadowed it all. All I tasted throughout the pizza was a lot of crust. Didn&#39;t taste much cheese as well which I feel is one of the keys to a great pizza.  
                  Still good but I miss the authenticity in the crust I got when the place first opened. I know most people see crust with blackened bubbles as burned but to me it gives that flavor you really want from a wood fired pizza.  To appeal to the masses, I assume, the crust is cooked through but is missing that charring.  I remember early reviews with complaints of burned crust, I guess the squeaky wheel gets the oil and ruins it for the rest of us.  Maybe I&#39;ll have to request well done or something next time.  
                  You know it&#39;s a darn good pizza when even a fitness freak like me eats all the crust.   JONASAPPROVED!  
                  Honestly I&#39;m pissed! Why you ask? Well this pizza is so darn good but so hard to get to. I have to navigate downtown, find parking, walk through the mass of people in San Pedro Square Market, validate my parking, and navigate out of downtown. Or I can try and find a place to sit and shamelessly eat my pizza.   I came here about a month ago with friends. It was my first time at San Pedro Square Market and I had to try this pizza. I love wood fire pizza, but its so hard to find unless you cough up the dough (the green paper variety). Well ever since my first taste of this place, I&#39;ve been craving it. It puts all my other pizza spots to shame. This is my predicament. Thanks a lot Pizza Bocca Lupo! Please open a second location.   The only downside, and I mean only, is the hot pans. My husband fried off his finger prints taking the pizza to the table. I saw another guy run into a chair and almost fumble the pizza as well. But in their defense, they do tell you its hot.  
                  Sometimes you forget how delicious simple food made with a handful or high quality ingredients can be. And then you come to a place like Pizza Bocca Lupo.  Lora, Angel, and I were starving. Sure. 15 minutes for a pizza beat 40 minutes for anything from The Counter that evening.  I don&#39;t know what possessed me to order a meatless pizza but dang. It was delish ( yelp.com/biz_photos/pizz… ). A thin and just ever so slightly charred crust covered in that sweet, but savory tomato sauce. Atop the sauce was rustic chopped garlic, mushrooms (gawd I love me some mushrooms), and roasted peppers, all studded in a bubbling mess of ooily gooily melted fresh mozz. Amaze.  Methinks the fire oven pizza thang makes for some pretty tasty eats.  
                  Review need to be updated.  So I went back to try out their pizza again n so a great  improvement.  Crust wasn&#39;t soggy like before.  Owner seem to listen to customer feedback which is great.  The pizza was actually good this time.  I&#39;ll be back to try the other toppings one.  
                  I am a Snob when it comes to Pizza. Everyone things they can make pizza but in reality very few make a great pizza. America has made pizza so main stream that I cant get a good slice unless im in New York.   But Pizza Bocco Lupo hits it out of the park with their Neopolatin Pizza. The dough makes all the difference and PBL&#39;s was light and Crispy.  I order the Margherita Pizza (being a pureist) and was not disappointed.  They hand slice the cheese and hand pick the Basil leaves and leave them whole for presentation.  The basil blended amazingly with the cheese and tomato sauce perfectly.  And the sauce was thick enough that it didn&#39;t make the pizza soggy.  I can only fathom what some of Pizza Bocco Lupos other pizzas tasted like. The food, service, and atmosphere (located in San Pedro Square which is an experience by itself) will definitely have me coming back when I am in town.  
                  For brunch, they offer two breakfast pizzas Sat/Sun 11-2.  I got the Danielo (potatoes, pancetta, mozzarella, eggs, $13): :  yelp.com/biz_photos/pizz…  It totally fails, because the pancetta/bacon flavor isn&#39;t strong enough; as a result, it&#39;s amost flavorless. It&#39;s not nearly as good as the Carbonara pizza at Pizzeria Delfina in Palo Alto.  Previous reports:  Warning: The Diavola pizza lives up to its name.  It&#39;s very hot, and can set your mouth on fire.  I can normally tolerate high heat, but not this one:  yelp.com/biz_photos/pizz…   The highlight was a pizza that was half &#34;Chef&#39;s Special&#34;, and half pesto:  yelp.com/biz_photos/pizz…  The flavors were very good.  The crust has reasonable char on the bottom:  yelp.com/biz_photos/pizz…  However, it&#39;s missing a &#34;spring to the chew.&#34;  It&#39;s like the dough falls flat, or wasn&#39;t allowed to rise enough.  So for me, it&#39;s OK, but not worth a trip.  My ranking for Neapolitan-style pizza:  1. Donato Enoteca, Redwood City (only the pesto pizza) 2. Pizzeria Delfina, Palo Alto (Carbonara pizza is often a special; it&#39;s the best) 3. Vesta, Redwood City (only the sausage/leek pizza) 4. Doppio Zero, Mountain View 5. Pizza Bocca Lupo, San Jose (anything other than Diavola) 6. Terune, Palo Alto 7. Napoletana Pizzeria, Mountain View: very wet/soggy  
                  I love pizza so much that it is hard for me to give anything lower than three stars. Pizza Bocca Lupo was not all that great for me. It was not memorable and I forgot what I even ordered. It was one of the specials on the bulletin that had prosciutto. They only carry two sizes here and that is either a whole pie or a half pie. With two hungry people, one whole pizza is just not enough! To top that off, the special that we ordered was almost 20 bucks. It was small, thin and lacked flavor. I ended up eating again after 2 hours. On the positive note, the service was great. It was my first time there so they went through some of the pizzas on the menu with me.  Since I am such a pizza fanatic, I may come back here and try something else on the menu if I&#39;m around the area.  
                  Love the pizza and watching the pie makers. The oven needs a good dusting. Nitpicking yes but I like attention to detail  
                  This was one of the few restaurants open on Labor Day in Downtown San Jose. The wait was around 45 minutes since there were lots of orders. However, the pizzas were good. I&#39;m a fan of wood-fire pizzas.  I had a Tom&#39;s Special which had tomato, Parmesan, mushrooms, and basil. Simple, yet really delicious flavors. My husband had the Bradley&#39;s Special which had mozzarella, Parmesan, prosciutto, oregano, and artichoke. This pizza did not have marinara sauce. Loved how the pizza crust was made to order and made with quality ingredients. The pizza had the perfect amount of cheese since it wasn&#39;t overwhelming. Pizzas were $13 each.  
                  I was so happy to discover this place!  In my opinion any restaurant that uses a wood-burning to make their pizzas tend to make a superior product just because the taste it gives the crust just can&#39;t be reproduced in an electric oven.  I also like the fact that they keep their pizzas simple and don&#39;t overload them with toppings.  I opted for the Joe which had sausages, mozzarella, mushrooms and basil.  Like I said before the wood-burning oven gave a nice charred taste to the crust.   They also used a higher quality mozzarella and the flavors balanced each other well.  Another thing I like about this place is that they have San Pellegrino sodas.   I love those but they have been hard to find in San Jose so far.  Apart from that service is fast and friendly.  I didn&#39;t wait long at all once I had ordered.  Give this place a try next time you&#39;re in San Pedro Square market.  It won&#39;t let you down.  
                  $15 napoletano pizza is a little over priced, but still worth it compared to the places at San Pedro Square.   I ordered a pepperoni and sausage pizza. There was a bit of a wait time and people crowding around the pick up area. I do wish that the pizza thinner and crispier.  
                  Pizza is very good plus they have great Italian wine. The only reason it wasn&#39;t 5 star is that they don&#39;t have Napa wines.... You can pay with pay pal! Great atmosphere, ask for Jorge, he is excellent with a lot of passion!  
                  I absolutely LOVE the pizzas here. My go-to is the margherita, with the occassional topping (extra $ for toppings though). Be warned, the wait for this place becomes super long on Sharks game days. But I gotta hand it to the workers here, they know how to get those pizzas out fast :) Pair your pie with a blood orange san pellegrino, and you&#39;re good to go.  Quick tip: make sure you use napkins to grab the sides of your pizza pan, because it comes out extremely fresh &amp; hot! Also, do not ask for to-go boxes because those are provided for you on the right side of the pickup counter (where the napkins are).  
                  I am a pizza whore! I have been to pizza places all over the US. I even did a pizza trip to New York! Discovering this little pizza place is yet another reason why I should never think I have already found good pizza places. There is always a pizza place out there to discover!  I love the wood fire oven! Not only does it look cool, but it definitely gives the pizza a different flavor. The crust on the pizza is delicious. Thin and crisp yet with a nice fluffiness in the crust. The use of San marzano tomatoes is a big plus! The best tomatoes to use! Sweet and juicy.   I love the ingredients they use. All fresh and tasty. The margarita pizza was very good. A nice sweet tomato sauce with fresh mozzarella and basil make a perfect combination. They make a really good pizza. You can never go wrong with fresh pizza dough, fresh ingredients!  
                  The Diavola is to DIE FOR!   Delicious pizzas, killer customer service, really awesome employees... can you get anything better? I think not! They even remember to cut the pizza into &#34;1/8&#34; ths for me and I don&#39;t even need to ask! LOVE IT!!!  
                  My favorite place in San Pedro! I love wood fired pizza and this is one of the best pizzas!  
                  They have a legit looking pizza oven that operates at 900 degrees, and they have the options of buffalo mozzarella, fior de latte, San Marzano tomatoes, etc, which are harder to find in the south bay.  We got the Chefs special, which had mozzarella, proscuitto, cherry tomatoes, and tomato sauce.  I like my crust thin, but theirs had a hard time supporting the toppings and got a little soggy from the tomato sauce.  The crust had a nice chew but could have used a little more flavor on its own?  Nonetheless, it&#39;s nice to see a real Neapolitan pizza oven.  
                  We had visited this place a few time&#39;s and it was delicious each time. Then at our last visit while eating there we looked into catering because we were planning our wedding and decided we would have it catered! The owner&#39;s are so nice! They did an amazing job. We had antipasti platters for appetizers then when the guest went into the reception they had garlic bread and salad waiting for them. I&#39;d say about 30 minutes later the dj called one table at a time to grab some pizza and we decided on 4 types of pizza options for our guest&#39;s. Our guests kept approaching us telling us how great the food was. Unfortunately as bride a groom we didn&#39;t get to eat much on our day lol but we went the next day and enjoyed it all! I recommend this place for people that want authentic fresh pizza. It&#39;s sooooo good! and get mozzarella cheese in your garlic bread lol. Thanks Ron and Jenneke for everything!  
                  My friend and I met here for dinner recently.  I really enjoyed my pizza.  My friend did not like the sausage on hers but I thought it was tasty.  I had the Capricciosa pizza.  It was very tasty.  I loved the toppings on it - Mushrooms, Artichokes, Pancetta, Kalamata olives, Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Crushed San Marzano Tomato Sauce, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil.    When my pizza was first ready, the counter person noticed something missing off of it so they actually made me a new pizza and brought it to me when it was ready.  Good customer service there.  Also, the other counter person was very helpful in getting me a box to take the leftovers home.    I definitely like this place and will try again when I am at San Pedro Square Market again.  
                  My favorite pizza in San Jose.  Perfect wood fired pizza.  
                  By far my favorite pizza place in San Jose! I love their neapolitan style of pizza where it&#39;s crispy but also soft and chewy so that you can fold the pizza in half while eating it. I&#39;m a big fan of how they use real mozzarella balls since it makes the pizza that much better. I&#39;ve gotten many different pizzas here and I have yet to have one that I do not like. One of my favorites is their bianca with the arugula and prosciutto on the pizza. They also have lunch specials where you got half a pizza and an arugula salad if you are unable to eat a whole pizza by yourself. It is on the pricier side if you are comparing other basic pizzas, but the high ingredients and quality makes this place worth it.
