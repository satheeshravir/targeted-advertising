                  I adore this place!   If you&#39;re from Davis, or if you&#39;ve ever been to Davis, Market Beer can be compared to that of Beer Shoppe or University of Beer. There&#39;s a variety of beers and ciders to choose from when you come here.   Market Beer is located in the Market Place of San Pedro Square in the same building as Treatbot. You truly can&#39;t miss it. What I love most about this place is how open it is. It&#39;s not cramped up and really, if you can find seating at San Pedro Square, you&#39;ve got super chill vibes.   My favorite thing to get here is the Lindeman&#39;s Peche Lambic. Yo girl is not a big fan of beer, because beer is definitely an acquired taste, so this is my go to drink when I hang out with my friends at San Pedro Square.   The workers are always super nice and they chat you up. They&#39;re also super helpful. If you&#39;re feeling adventurous, you have hundreds of beers to choose from, so why not? They also have specials on tap, so go check it out next time you&#39;re in the area.  
                  This is a free standing shop within the mini mall.  They have a large number of refrigerated cases for bottled beers and a few on tap.  Staff is very eager to provide samples, even if you&#39;re not thinking you gonna be buying....though I ended up getting a half pint.   Good selection, and a welcome stop in the area.  
                  Beer, beer, and well more beer.  This is a little fancy beer spot in the San Pedro Square market. They have a ton of different beers.  Some really expensive, and some not so much. There are beers so large that you can share with another.   They also have a few on tap, so if you don&#39;t want one of those extremely large ones, then it would be perfect for you. Overall, it&#39;s a small little location, and overall, the quality of the beer is quite good. I had a coconut one that went down smooth and tasted great. Thumbs up.  
                  Best place for hard ciders or craft beers! Customer service is always great! They always greet me, help me with my questions, and lead me to a drink I am in the mood for that day. I enjoy coming here, and come here often, My fiance loves Double IPA&#39;s and it&#39;s a win-win for us. I get a cider, or a new blond beer, and he has a pick of the litter in double IPA&#39;s. Thank you for the amazing service and thank you for your large selection of beers and ciders!  
                  Love coming here.    They always have some great rotating handles and I always discover a new beer or brewery.    So what is this place?  Basically a place to have a brew and chill in the San Pedro Square.  Only a handful of drafts, but they rotate and always have a decent selection.  The real value is in the fridge.  Pretty sizable selection and I always see them restocking.  Rate Beer ratings on the front are clearly marked and workers generally know their stuff.  Great place to discover new craft brews.  My most recent discovery here: Mother Earth brew co.  * seems to be a hop heads heaven brewing company.  I like everything I&#39;ve tried from them so far...  
                  TL;DR: Wide selection. Great service. Pricey.   Nice selection of beers. Lots of IPAs and porters. Around the corner there are some fancier ciders, champagnes, and lambics on the side fridge. They even have the Lindeman&#39;s peche (peach), and kriek (cherry) fruit beers. The Karl Strauss peanut butter cup porter is a unique addition to the mix as well.   Service is great. The bartender is very friendly and sociable.   The only thing I have to complain about is the price of some of the bottles. A few of the beers were reasonable, but certain ones were marked up way too high. The peanut butter cup porter was $17! But alas, when you&#39;re downtown, I suppose you must pay downtown prices.  
                  Draft beer &amp; bootled beers are available. Today, 3-5-16, I had the Lost Abbey Red Hoppy, a sour, on tap &amp; I think my husband had a rye IPA called, 8 Bridges Maple Ripa - I probably got that name wrong, not a good thing to write a review after sleuth of beers...well just for one beer for me. Anyway, we have been here a few times already, draft beers are always good! This place is located in one of two food court buildings of San Pedro Market Square.  
                  The best selection of craft beers in downtown San Jose. The prices are reasonable for the quality of craft beer they offer. The workers are very knowledgeable and will find you the right beer if you&#39;re in the mood for something they don&#39;t have. They have the gamut of beers ranging from IPA, Double IPA, Triple IPA, Ales, Stout, Hefeweizen, Lagers, Ciders, Lambic anything you can think of they have.   If you have a favorite brewery like Firestone, Ballast Point, Ommegang, Ninkasi, Green Flash, Knee Deep, etc there is a good chance you will find those beers at the Market Beer Co. For newcomers to the Market Beer Co. I would definitely look at the % alc just encase you pick out a beer that is 11%+ and not realize how strong it would actually be.  If you&#39;re in the downtown area and want a good place to kick back and grab a beer the Market Beer Co is a must. Remember this place is conveniently located inside of San Pedro Square Market so if you get hungry you won&#39;t be short on options.  
                  Awesome beer selection! They have 8 brews on tap and a whole ton of bottled.  The guys that work the counter are really cool, down to earth people. There&#39;s seating for about 16 people (2 tables of 8) within the immediate proximity and a ton more in the Open Market.  The brews are on the more expensive side. I recommend starting a night of bar hopping here then heading to other spots close by.   Another plus is that there&#39;s TONS of of food options in the area.   I&#39;m giving this place 3 stars instead of 5 because of relative price to other options and because there&#39;s always a decent line / wait. Stars will go up if wait goes down.  
                  Housed within the &#39;food court&#39; at the Market Place in SJ, MBC is an oasis of beer amid eateries.  The young men who work the taps are friendly and passionate about beer.  This is how it should be.  Craft beer from all over California seems to be sold here.  I purchased a few choice-looking bottled brewskis from breweries located in Santa Clara, San Jose and San Diego.  The prices sometimes seem a bit dear, but one is supporting microbreweries and not Anheuser-Busch, so a bit of understanding is key.    If I lived in the area, then I&#39;d be a super repeat customer as this place is a gem of the craft beer scene.  
                  We love craft beer, so we decided to grab a few bottles of good beer and enjoy them with friends at San Pedro Square. You can purchase bottles and grab a few glasses and bring them outside or wherever you can find a spot that suits you.  We went with a Delirium Tremens, which is one of my favorite of all time. I bought a Bruery Mischief, a Belgian Pale and the St. Bernardus Tripel to share as well. We all had beer samplings with our meal that we purchased across the way at Bray. Beer and BBQ are some of my favorite things!   Loved the Market Beer Co and glad there is a place like this to buy bottles for here or to go!  
                  Great beer selection at reasonable prices. Knowing what these beers cost at markets, their asking prices are really not that bad. if you see a $20 beer, most likely it costs $16.99+ at liquor store or market. Just remember, they have to make their money somehow!  You take your beer(s) to the register and they ask you how many glasses you need and if you&#39;d like them to open/pour the beer out in the glasses, or just open it for you and let you pour it out yourself once you get to the table. They also have a couple of beers on tap too.  
                  How did I not notice this place inside SP Square before?! This place has the chill vibes of a tap room but the crazy selection of a super-powered store!  Visited in March of 2015, and they had SO MANY IPA&#39;s (Stone, god bless!) on tap for $8!! Even though they only have about 8 beers on tap, never fear because they have refrigerator-door-sized-display cases that house a range of craft bottled beers from belgians to dark chocolately stouts (my absolute favorite, Campfire Stout was there too!!).   Because Market Beer Co. is inside SP Square (on the side of Treatbot and Konjoe), it gets crowded quick since there are only a few standing-only tables for drinkers to rest their beer glasses on. Came here with co-workers and all 6 of us politely took up half of a table, sharing the rest of the standing space with a couple who somehow got bar stools! HOW?! Anyways, there are also large TV&#39;s for the single beer drinkers looking to kill some time or disengage from conversation.   Vibes are chill because of the open floor plan of SP Square, but it gets loud and intense on Friday-weekend nights when people are going out and drinking. Shoutout to the dude pouring my beer because he was really laid-back and approachable--I love that about fellow beer lovers!  
                  Probably the only saving grace at San Pedro Square. It&#39;s consistent and honest. The employees really know their selection and can help you if you know what style of beer you like.  
                  By all means, I&#39;m no beer snob but thanks to a buddy of mine who gave me an eye opener on beer, I now know how serious beer drinkers can be . . . and how smooth and flavorful a good beer should really taste like.   If you&#39;re in the mood for a good beer or something new to try, this is a great place - it has a great selection of beer to choose from (over 200 varieties from what the sign says!) and I love how the BeerAdvocate ratings are posted . . . saves me time and battery life on my phone trying to search for a rating! Staff is friendly and very knowledge . . . any questions, ask away! I haven&#39;t been disappointed with any of their recommendations.  Located in the second building of San Pedro Square Market, this place is in a perfect location (although the price is more due to this reason!).   Grab a bite,  share a beer, or take a bottle home . . .  whatevs it may be, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll enjoy! CHEERS!  
                  If you have a passion for beer---this is a great place to hangout. They have a wide selection, from sweetest to dark. My spouse loves beer and she&#39;d always try anything that she finds new.  Pick your beer, pay at the register, get a table and ENJOY!  
                  Per capita, probably the best beer selection in San Jose. But note I did not say cheapest. Or most well stocked.  Located in the second building of San Pedro Market (it was month&#39;s before I even knew about the second building), you might not be impressed by the limited taps and few cases. Until you look into those cases. You will see two impressive numbers: the Beer Advocate rating, and the price. In most cases, both will be double digit, but if you see that 100 at $14? You buy it.  Take your time as you peruse the cases, and ask questions to other patrons. Now here is the fun part: you can grab and go, you can get the bottles uncorked (and they will give you the appropriate glass), or see what they have on tap. And while there may be a line, talk to the staff: they are incredibly knowledgeable - heck one of the guys is brought out to breweries to brew with them. But if you do talk and make a purchase, move to the side so they can multitask.   And don&#39;t feel bad to ask about stuff. These guys know their beer. My plan: become a regular patron, find out when they are getting even more impressive stuff, try not to destroy my liver.  This last trip I got an Apex and Maharaja. Both were highly praised by the staff, and they were right: both were delicious.   Tip: Depending on their selection, a unique dessert option is going with a milk stout, getting a cookie from the place next to it, and enjoying. Vanilla porters are also an option.  
                  This place is cool, and the dudes (seemingly all bearded) who work here will always steer you in the right direction, towards the right bottle. The fridges are packed with the best of the best from all sorts of styles of beer. And there&#39;s even a little cider section tucked around the corner for those looking for a change-of-pace (or gluten-free alternative). Plus there&#39;s always a nice tap selection, with local breweries often featured. The prices can be a tad steep, but you&#39;re paying for an awesome experience, and MBC provides just that.   Come with friends, grab a treat from the fridge, pair it with a tasty bite from one of the many spots inside San Pedro Square Market, and have a good time. 5 stars. Easy.  
                  Great selection with friendly service. Prices seem in line with everywhere else, but i would recommend the bottles over the tap because the tap is usually rare or cult beer and costs more per ounce.   I love that they have BeerAdvocate ratings for everything, and the store workers seem very knowledgeable and excited to talk suds.   Great cider selection in the corner cooler, too.  
                  For curious drinkers relatively new to craft brews, the selection is more than enough to choose between and the scoring system is helpful if you want an idea of what is well rated by others.   For connaisseurs who know what they want or who are very picky, they may or may not have what you are looking for. They do carry other brews (such as Pliny the Elder), but you have to ask for them as they are not put on display.   As for me, this is a chill place to browse a good variety of bottles and crack one (or more) open to enjoy with a couple of friends.  
                  What a great selection of beer!!!! Can be a wee pricey depending on what beer you get.  I&#39;ve been here three times. Every single time I come here the staff is extremely helpful. Whatever I&#39;m in the mood for, they can match me up with a bottle. You can tell that they&#39;re either alcoholics/experts of beer or they&#39;re just highly trained. Or both.  
                  Huge selection of craft beers.  With a revolving door of selections.  I love how you can take a pint anywhere in the Market Square.  Our team goes here all the time - we are OG.  And friendly service.  They know beer like we know steak....we knows our steak peoples.  - Film Antics  
                  Great beer selection. I&#39;ve never seeing any of these beers before. It really helped to have the description for the crafted beers. There was some seating area but you can always seat elsewhere. Got 4 different types of beer and shared it with friends :D  Even made it to the caltrain just in time! Thank goodness its so close by! About a mile away.  
                  Hugely awesome selection of craft beers, and a very good variety of (local even!) craft ciders!   The staff is super knowledgable and if you get lucky and run into the manager he&#39;ll help you out with stuff he&#39;s got out back that&#39;s not right in the display case.   You get some great IPA&#39;s for all you hop lovers, legit selection of Belgians, California craft support all over, and a variety of other phenomenal styles.  
                  craft beer king.  
                  No, you won&#39;t find your OE or Mickey&#39;s or Red Dog here. Sorry, but you won&#39;t find your Bud, Coors or Miller Lite here either.  Instead you will find the tastiest bombers sold here all in one big fridge, all at your very arms&#39; length. Bravo!  I was excited to see the extensive selection that comprised the Market Beer Co. which included the likes of Ballast Point, Allegash Ale, and Ninkasi to name a few. MBC also provides the curious consumer information on how each beer rates amongst its competition. In addition, there&#39;s a small selection on tap where you can enjoy a fresh pour from the guy behind the counter. This, we were informed, is ever changing, so you might not have the brew you had the last time you were there.  What&#39;s also awesome about this place is you can purchase a beer here have them open it and hand you a glass to enjoy anywhere around the SPSM vicinity.  That&#39;s too much awesome right there: you&#39;re not stuck having to post in one spot while you finish your beer; you can totally pick up shop and head to grab a bite elsewhere, listen to some music or catch the game nearby.    I&#39;m in LOVE with this place. Literally. Good place to stock up on some good beer. SPSM continues to exceed my expectations! What&#39;s next!?  
                  I really enjoy the beer selection here. The guys that work here are really cool and always happy to answer any questions you may have. Most of the time I ask for their recommendations depending on what I&#39;m in the mood for that day and I haven&#39;t been disappointed once. The hardest part here is finding a place to sit to enjoy your beer afterwards! Try finding a seat outside-- you can take your beer with you. :)  
                  They just had a Green Flash tap takeover:  5/5: The Ristretto Cosmic Black Lager is OMG.  It&#39;s like a sweet, malty, syrupy double bock, jacked up with a whole lot of espresso.  It&#39;s like a beer/espresso milkshake.  It&#39;s a Don&#39;t miss.  
                  Love love love love love LOVE!   As a lover of craft brews, I was very excited to see this place.  The whole idea is that you pick up a bottle to share with friends, and their selection is simply epic.  They have all kinds of beers here including some really hard to find ones like Boulevard (from Kansas City).  I was thoroughly impressed.    I will definitely be returning here to try some more fun beers!  The owner is also incredibly nice and friendly.  It was great getting to chat with him about the place, and great that he didn&#39;t get annoyed with all of my questions. :)  
                  We came here on a beautiful lazy Sunday and ran into this new establishment offering many selections of various beer brews. I am not an avid beer drinker so I wasn&#39;t as enthusiastic as the husband and friend.   There are dozens and dozens of different brand/types to choose from which can be a bit overwhelming but the gentleman manning the counter was very helpful and friendly. He had many suggestions and each one we tried were outstanding. He also informed us that they are working on getting beer on tap installed in the near future, so that should be worth waiting for.  Prices are what you&#39;d expect for premium brews and there is a $2 corkage fee. Most of the brews are $8 to $20 + dollars. The bottles are large enough for 2 healthy servings.   Overall we tried 3 different brews that day and will be returning to try some more next time. Nice addition to the San Pedro Square Market. We saw many customers enjoying beers with their Sunday lunch/brunch. This establishment is exactly what San Pedro needed.  5 Stars  
                  They have a great selection of &#34;craft&#34; beers.  The two employees I met, one of which may have well been the owner, were excellent.  I bought a package of Preparation H wipes after on the way home to prepare myself for the next day.  
                  Great selection of beer for a good price! They also have the rating (0-100) under the names of the beer, which is helpful when you&#39;re selecting. You can buy your beer and they&#39;ll give you a glass to poor your drink in then you&#39;re free to find seating anywhere in San Pedro square market! I love coming here and will definitely be back to try some more brews.  
                  I love this place. So many good craft beers. It&#39;s such a refreshing change from your typical Blue Moon-type stuff that every bar has. It&#39;s slightly cheaper than most bars too.  
                  If you&#39;re new to craft beers, this is a great place to start. Their fridges are picked with different types of craft beers, though they are mostly IPAs, stouts, and ales. The selection is pretty damn good though you won&#39;t find anything super rare.  If you don&#39;t know what to get, don&#39;t be afraid to ask the staff what they recommend. They&#39;ll take the time to help you narrow down your selection based on the style of beer or flavor profile that you like. There is certainly no mistaking that these guys know their beers. It&#39;s also helpful that each beer has an individual tag in the fridge with not just it&#39;s price but official scores and descriptions from beer advocate.  The location is great since you can grab a bite to eat from the other nearby shops in the same center or get some ice cream from Treatbot to go with your beer!  
                  Looking, looking, looking, pondering, browsing, contemplating, and finally choosing a beer. It happens every time, but what is to be expected when you have a good 200 craft beers to choose from. Micro breweries from locals to far off breweries in other countries. I love this place; I can&#39;t make a trip to San Pedro Square Market without stopping by and picking out a new bottle to try.   It&#39;s a super simple place; refrigerators like the ones in liquor stores filled with a beautiful sight....beers upon beers. Other than that, there is the counter where you pay, pick up however many glasses you want, and where they offer about 6 beers on tap that change regularly. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s all there is too it. So simple yet so amazing!  The reason that I&#39;m giving this 4 stars instead of 5 even though I love this place, is the price. I knew it was a bit pricey, but when I went to Iso Beers, another place I love and very similar, I saw the same beers; some of which were 2/3 the price. $10 compared $15 is why it&#39;s getting 4. Still love the place though and I keep coming back.  
                  Tons and Tons of beer to choose from! All sorts and different sizes! The employees that work here are very helpful just in case you cant decide on what to drink. My favorite one ( if you like wheat beer) is Wild Wit!! Worth every penny =)   The prices are reasonable, some beers are a little pricey, but in the end when you&#39;re feeling the alcohol kick in....it wont even matter at that point lol  
                  Looking in hindsight, what made Market Beer Co so great was that there was always a magnanimous presence at the shop to greet you and that was the manager. Now that he&#39;s gone -- well a lot of the feel and spirit of the shop is gone. I haven&#39;t seen a tap takeover, or SF Beer week event at MBC at all since the day the manager left.  So now that the man who built their community is gone, what&#39;s left:  + still can bring food in from anywhere else + still has good bottle selection + still good place to get beer at SPSM  - tap selection is not in same league as before - still no bar stools - still no water available - still no chalkboard to show the beer menu  I no longer frequent this place as a destination craft beer bar anymore. My preference is to go to the other craft beer shops where there is a community rooted there.  Update: Still do tap takeovers and some event-type stuff -- Just haven&#39;t seen anything because they don&#39;t update their social anymore (which they started doing again today after I updated the review). Kind of whoomp whoomp, they do these things and I don&#39;t really care because the community has moved on. Anyway, I&#39;m happy SPSM can still get some great beers, although the fire is gone. I upgraded the review to A-OK.  
                  Beers are slightly overpriced here compared to other places, but the selection is good. It is San Jose though, so not exactly unexpected. It&#39;s just inside the San Pedro Market. This place is basically a wall of fridges (3 I think?) with a variety of craft beers. Only one person mans the counter and they have some beers on tap, though it&#39;s not like they have a ton.  There are tables nearby for seating and enjoying your drink, but they&#39;re small tables. Good enough for a small group though! No food I believe, but there are plenty of places nearby to grab a bite. There are tables everywhere of course, since it is San Pedro square.   Probably wouldn&#39;t come back, but beer wise I guess not terrible. Would much rather go elsewhere for drinks because I&#39;ve seen most of their selection at BevMo these days. I did see some of Rabbit Foot&#39;s Meadery beer on tap though so as least they have some of the stuff that is harder to find.  
                  Thank God for this place. San Jose is generally a boring place but this is giving me some hope. I come here with my Pops on Sunday&#39;s to grab a beer and watch a game, but it could also be for a date or a place to go out with the bros  
                  The prices are a bit high here, but they usually have something unique on tap that always draws me in.  The staff is very knowledgable a good peeps.  There are plenty of food options to nom on in the market area.  I try to swing by here when I can.  
                  After a great dinner, I walked over to ask for a beer similar to Stone&#39;s Enjoy By.  I told the guy that I&#39;m looking for an IPA but nothing w/ a fruity aftertaste.  I recall Craig telling me that he doesn&#39;t care for flavored alcohol.  I didn&#39;t recognize any of the beer except for Rogue&#39;s selections but I left it up to the guy to give me 3 to choose from.  The one I decided to get is a triple IPA from Green Flash Brewing Company: Green Bullet.    At the counter, a guy asked if I wanted it in a glass.  I laughed and explained that I will take it home w/ me to surprise my boyfriend but how great is that?  A different experience than being at a bar.   Awesome beer knowledge.  I can&#39;t wait to enjoy San Pedro Square w/ him.  
                  A huge variety of beers in one location in an awesome marketplace full of different foods.  You can just walk right up to the glass doors and choose which beer you want, though it may take up to ten minutes or so if you peruse their entire selection.  There&#39;s definitely a more weighted selection towards IPAs but that just means more happiness to me!  They do have about 5 taps on hand and I&#39;m pretty sure they rotate them monthly or so but it&#39;s definitely worth it to try the unique beers in the fridge.  If you choose to drink at the market, they will lend you goblets that will actually add to the flavor of the beer depending on the which you choose, much like wine does.  I do see a lot of review stating that the selection isn&#39;t that big or the prices are higher than regular market price. NO SH!T..... This place isn&#39;t a an actual market where you purchase your goods and take home; it&#39;s an open food court of sorts in which you can actually drink your beer as soon as you buy it.  Think of the extra payment as paying for the premium of cracking open a cold one and hanging with your buds.  And again, it&#39;s not a bevmo, so I wouldn&#39;t be comparing the selection there to this establishment....  They do have more beers on hand than most bars/restaurants.  Some yelpers are hard to please.  
                  The woman who helped us out here knew her stuff (she&#39;s one of only 4 people who work there). They have an impressive selection, and she was great with navigating through the choices.  I&#39;m not sure where else you can find this many different beers in the South Bay, let alone a place where you can enjoy those beers then and there.   I would highly recommend that you grab glasses and take your drinks out to the patio - it gives it a nice beer garden feel.  
                  Market Beer is so fun! I&#39;m a regular, I&#39;m here almost every Friday. The staff is super helpful and I always end up picking a winner.   To give you a feel for what its like here: - Giant food court, this place is tucked into the back over by Blush.  - You pick out a beer from the giant selection in the fridge case. - You pay for said beer.  - Find somewhere to sit or stand and enjoy said beer.  Two thumbs up! Wish there was more seating though, it can get rather hectic on a Friday night. MOAR SEATING PLEASE!  
                  This place has an impressive assortment of 22oz bottles of beers from a bunch of micro breweries from all over. The sign on the wall says &#34;Over 200 types of bottled beers&#34; or something to that effect. They also have a few draft beers on tap so I went for the Apex IPA, it was REAL nice and complimented my Pork Belly Sandwich from Konjoe perfectly. I would give them 5 stars but I&#39;ve already handed out 6 five star ratings at the San Pedro Market (this location is awesome!) and this place really is only a re-seller so nothing that novel. The pint of beer was $7 as well, pretty steep for 16oz...  
                  From a value perspective, this place gets four stars by giving you great access to a vast beer selection at a pretty decent price.  I have to give them five stars though, because this place is a big factor in what makes San Pedro Market the great food/hangout spot that it is.  
                  Market Beer Co. is in the quieter San Pedro Market, next to Blush.  It&#39;s got 2 full cases full of beer.  I don&#39;t like beer, but I do like the look of the labels &amp; they&#39;ve been open only 3 days!  One of the guys working there answered some of my questions.  They have lots of imported beer like  La Trappe from The Netherlands.  He mentioned beers from San Diego, Petaluma (Lagunitas Brewing Co), Palo Alto  Brewing Company &#34;Hoppy Ending Pale Ale&#34;.  He said one of his favorite is Stone Brewing Co.  Funny name for a beer from Stone Brewing Co: Arrogant Bastard Ale.  Too many beers to name, check it out if you like beer.  Many Sharks fans have already checked it out.  
                  Whomever set up this place did it right. I&#39;m especially impressed with the customer service I receive from Thomas.  
                  It&#39;s definitely a puzzling experience choosing from 200 craft beers. They also have a few tap beers, but compared to the bottled one, they have less alcohol content. For you gluten free folks, they have a couple of cider to choose from. Please make sure to tip!  This is a market place, so plan on eating something while you sip on that palette cleansing beer!  
                  If you love beer you will love this spot! Not only do they have a fantastic selection of unique and delicious beers, their staff are incredibly helpful at helping you pick the brew that is right for you! They&#39;ve got wonderful seasonal selections and can always recommend something if you get overwhelmed with the options. If you like Belgian beers, IPAs, lagers, you name it, they&#39;ve got it or something similar to it! They have mostly bottles but they have a few on tap. Another great feature is their rating system. They have the beers rating under every bottle so you can compare. Not only that, they give you the proper vessel for your libation as to best enjoy. Also, if you are out at the market and want to take food home, you can grab a beer from here to help pick up the meal you&#39;re taking home! Or the beer enthusiast or the beer noob, this is a place for all!!  
                  Honestly I can&#39;t go to San Pedro Square and not stop in here, whether to drink it NOW  or take it home. I love chatting with the staff about the selection, they always come up with a beer I&#39;ve never tried and they&#39;re almost always spot on with their recommendations.  Not feeling chatty? No problem, beers are rated with descriptions under each bottle. You could spend hours studying &#39;em!  Don&#39;t go for the beers you know, try something new! you won&#39;t be disappointed. Paired with a burger from across the court I&#39;m a very happy camper!  
                  Nice selection of tasty beverages in bottles. Although they seem to be a dollar or two more than other places, but given the location that is understandable.   The rotating on tap selections are great and usually what I go for.   The staff has been friendly, knowledgable, and helpful in recommending something new or different.  
                  MARKET BEER COMPANY is a great place to hit up while in the San Pedro Market Place. I have been twice and they have a great bottle selection, and 2-3 good beers on tap. I&#39;ve had a Firestone Walker Union Jack and a Bear Republic Apex on tap. Their bottles are a bit pricey compared to a liquor store, but in line with most restaurants.  Get more than 5 beers on tap, and I will add a 5th star. Until then... 4.5.  
                  Although Market Beer only has a couple of taps of draft beer, they do hold the prized and coveted  real estate that is St Pedro Square Market!  Thus, seating availability doesn&#39;t become an issue here.  The food to go with the beer...not their problem since their neighbors will handle it.  All they do is beer...bottled and draft.   I came here twice this past week for Silicon Valley Beer Week.  The first visit was for the Green Flash/Ninkasi tap takeover.  They had a lot of good rare draft beers not available in bottles or the keg.  The Green Flash and Ninkasi reps there were awesome.  They chatted with us about their brand&#39;s beer and all the greatness of visiting their brewery in San Diego and Eugene, OR respectively.  I had the Green Flash Super Freak...a sour beer and the first sour I&#39;ve ever had.  Suffice to say,  I can&#39;t say that I&#39;m a fan of sours at the moment.  It definitely takes some getting used to.  Also the bottled beer here is a priced a bit more than Bevmo and Whole Foods due to it being served and carried in the SPSM.  If your favorite is in the cold case, then it&#39;s a nice way to serve chilled brew and drink right away with friends.  Beer always tastes better when shared with others.  SPSM can get crowded on weekends so weeknights are ideal for a quiet relaxing chill environment to drink beer and hangout.  That&#39;s what I&#39;m planning to do for sure!  
                  Want good beer? Check this place out!  It&#39;s a one stop shop for beer basically. They have so many selections of beer and they have the ratings of the beer too which make it really easy for you to gauge what you want, especially if you&#39;re not quite as familiar with beer. I had a difficult time choosing and the guy working took the time to explain some stuff and actually gave me an excellent recommendation. You pick your beer, pay for it, and they give you the glass to drink out of. They also have some beer on tap but the selection is really small.   It&#39;s a great addition to your meal or if you just feel like drinking in San Pedro Market :)  
                  I don&#39;t mind the prices of the beers. I do enjoy the atmosphere, and the guys manning the registers are really knowledgeable about their beers. My only one small, tiny, micro complaint would be, their refrigeration system could be slightly colder. Yes, I understand the doors are being constantly open and shut, but still.  
                  Great selection and groovy joint to hang out in. Honestly a little expensive for my taste. But for a day showing the buds around the town I would definitely stop here.  
                  With craft beer really garnering a popular (and rabid!) following, there&#39;s no shortage of places to explore the wares. Market Beer Co&#39;s &#34;enjoy here or take home&#34; bottle selection adds a unique outlet to the scene and makes for another great addition to the rich cast of characters that make San Pedro Square Market already so appealing.  The refrigerators are stocked with a fairly rich and wide array of liquid bread, from adventurous and bold local brews to renowned Belgians to select chase crafts - something for most palates. Many of the beers are adorned with a rating and a brief description, guiding both the veteran and the uninitiated; a nice bit of detail considering every porter isn&#39;t smoky or chocolate-y, some sours are tart while others are vinegar-ish, and sometimes hops can punch you in the mouth (and maybe you&#39;re into that, I&#39;m not judging).  Even with the insights from  ratebeer.com (?) descriptions, sometimes you need a little help deciding between two or five different bottles that all sound awesome. Its really a boon to have knowledgeable and enthusiastic staff helping make recommendations and suggestions. The personnel here are very friendly and provide great attention to customer service, fostering a fun and welcoming environment.  The prices will perhaps be the point of contention for most reviewers; indeed, these premium brews come at some premium prices (plus the &#34;drink on premises&#34; corkage fee), but the escalation in costs, in my opinion, is justified by the venue, the ambiance, the vibe. True, I can buy most of these beers elsewhere for notably less and share them with a friend on my couch, but to enjoy the festivity of people watching and galavanting and simply being out in the world?  Well worth a couple extra dollars. Class it up, beer drinkers. ________________________________________ Craft brew by the bottle, poured to a heady froth into big stemmed glasses, while pretty people strut by...?  Yeah, I&#39;m down for that.  
                  Not the biggest selection ever but still a pretty decent variety of craft brews for the amount o space they have. They can open up the bottle and u can drink it there rite away.  The bottles are def a lil on the pricier side. Im pretty sure u can get some o the beers for less at bevmo or wutevers. Each bottle is on avg around $12 and they split perfectly into two glasses so if u split wit a friend its bout $6 a glass which is pretty much standard for a beer at the bar anyway.  They also have a rotating selection o beers on tap. Couple weeks ago i was able to try a curry stout which was strange but interesting.  Only cons are most o the beers are a lil heavier...pale ales, stouts, ipa, porters....they dont hav a lot o hef, blondes, or lagers.  Also u pretty much need a friend to share a bottle with u unless u wanna drank two beers...otherwise ur limited to the stuff on tap.  
                  I guess the cupcake place is exiled? The new dessert place has cupcakes so i guess the market dessert quotient remains. Id been in Copenhagen recently where Mikkeler is king. They had 2 out in the coolers and one in the back but they were all ones ive had. However the fact they have Beer Geek Breakfat is a total win. The guy working says the inventory will grow slightly so im looking forward to an even better selection  
                  They have a lot of beers here if you&#39;re a beer fan. My fiance bought two different beers for us and I didn&#39;t like any. It was way too strong for me. There&#39;s a few fridges for you to choose from and also a few on tap. Reasonable prices. Inside the market square.  
                  Always take my friends here. Whenever someone is visiting. Good selection of beers. Knowledgable people at the forefront.  
                  Great selection of beers to choose from. Don&#39;t be afraid to ask! There has to be a beer out there that will satisfy your palette.   I was impressed to even see atleast 4 different flavored ciders available since everything has to be gluten free for me!   Enjoy your beer with the plethora of food nearby. $9 for a bottle of cider to myself followed by a good buzz = a happy Mellanie. Don&#39;t forget to tip! ;)  
                  WOWOWOWOW!!   This place is amazing!! If you like BEER, definitely a must go when your visiting San Pedro Square Market! They pretty much have something for everyone. Lots of bottles of craft beer and some beers on tap.   The bartender, if that&#39;s what you would call him, was AWESOME! He was so helpful and friendly. My friend and I went the other night and were craving some specific tasting beer. He walked us over and showed us some different options and explained how they tasted. We picked out a couple and they were seriously delicious! I&#39;m fairly new in my craft beer addition and I can see coming to this place and being overwhelmed, but the bartender just made me feel right at home. I went back two other times that night and the bartender picked out a couple other great choices!   I HIGHLY recommend trying this place out!   One of my new favorites that I was just introduced to is the campfire stout by High Water brewing!! Seriously tastes like smores!  
                  Awesome addition to San Pedro Square Market!  Beer for sale to drink anywhere in the market or to-go.  Market Beer Co. is in the Lusardi Building, right across the way from Pho-nomenal.  Pho and craft beer?????  Worlds colliding!!!      Several self-serve fridges filled with beers of all kinds.  Grab your beer from the fridge and check-out at the cashier.  They also provide glassware if you&#39;d like to drink it at the Market.  I grabbed a Dogfish Head 75 minute IPA (750 mL) for $14.    They&#39;ll be installing taps in the future!  
                  This place has so much going for it. The selection of beers is pretty good. It&#39;s an awesome location within SPSM with tons of tables and chairs to sit and drink. A great alternative to the Market Bar, which I love, but sometimes you just want to chill with a beer. The refrigerated display is great to just browse, and the staff are amazing when it comes to making recommendations. They know a lot about what they have and that just makes the experience even better.   So why not 5 stars? Here&#39;s why:  1. (The main reason) They have this stupid corkage fee. $2. It&#39;s so random and unnecessary. Basically, if you buy the beer and leave and drink it elsewhere, there&#39;s no fee. But if you sit and drink it there, they give you glasses, but also charge you $2. Wtf? I just bought the beer from YOU. That&#39;s like the Pho place charging you for some Pho but extra if you want to sit and eat it there. LAME.  2. The prices are a tad bit high compared to other beer stores. I did a comparison of a Belgian that I purchased here for $18 (750 mL) with the new beer store in downtown Mtn View, and they had it for $14. Now add $2 additional to drink it there, and...um ha ha yeah.  3. They need to expand their selection of sour beers.   In the end, I really really like this place. I want to love it, but...well...you can read above.  
                  The selection here is undeniable. No need to wade through lots of mass production beer in order to find what you want. It&#39;s also nice to see the ratings on right there next to the beers.   They have cool glassware to go with the beer when you buy it if you were getting it to go with a meal which for certain beers is important to the taste much like a wine.   My only complaint is price, if they have the same beer at another place it&#39;s usually cheaper than here.  
                  Great selection of beers - a bit over-priced, not as rare as you&#39;d think. Just hit up BevMo if you wanna stock up on a newly discovered fave brew!  The customer service was great! Friendly and knowledgeable staff are what make businesses successful. The fellas here know what&#39;s up.  
                  +:  The quantity of beer is pretty good. If your drinking for one, you can get more than 2 glasses in one of these or split it between 2. Also, there are a few gems that I can decipher and the beer quality of those are very good  -:  While the employee who is usually there in the evening hours is really nice, I wish they did more to help explain what is a really good beer to try. Most of these beers are ones you will never hear of and while anyone can appreciate the main stream beer, it&#39;s good to know what you will be spending 10-15 bucks on  
                  Very cool place, was passing through and had read this place had a nice selection of bombers as well as several beers on tap. The staff was very friendly and helped me pick out quite a few selections to take home while I sipped on something from the tap.  
                  THE BEST PLACE TO ENJOY CRAFT OR MICROBREWED BEER!  Hands down.  The ambiance of the Market Beer Co allows for you to enjoy a variety of food and entertainment.  The fact that I can swing by and grab some of the most unique beers I have seen to date (and as a former U.S. Marine I&#39;ve had my share of alcoholic beverages) this is hands down one of, if not, THE favorite place for me to enjoy these unique flavors.  
                  Hold up!  Hey-ay-ay-ayeee!  Drink beer everyday!  Well, drink in moderation because you don&#39;t want to destroy your liver.  Your liver serves as a vital organ in keeping you alive; flushing away the toxins from your body, filters your blood, creates bile and proteins.  Without ur liver u r a died people.  Wut?  Market Beer Company is located in the heart of San Pedro Square Market.  With many beers to choo-choo-choose from (I&#39;m a train), you&#39;ll feel like you&#39;re in beer heaven.  Not only are there beers in bottles, but they also have beers on tap!  Go ahead, homie!  Get yo&#39; drank on!  After chowing down on some delicious poutine fries, we needed some refreshments to wash down the fries, gravy, cheese and grease.  Behold!  Market Beer, ahoy!  Looking at all those beers made me belt out some sexy-super-delicious David Bowie lyrics-- &#34;I gazed a gazely stare, at all the millions here!&#34;  Well, there wasn&#39;t millions of beers, but the selection was good enough for us.  My fake girlfriend got some apple cider beer and I got Delirium Tremens.  The beers were kind of pricey, but they were big enough to share.  Like, if you bought a bottle of beer here and you bought 2 glasses of the same beer at a bar, it would probably be the same price, if not close.  The service was friendly.  The guy had a freakin&#39; gold grill!  He was like the asian Nelly.  I was like ,&#34;Smile fo&#39; me daddy!  I want to see yo&#39; grill!&#34;  Actually, if I said that to him he&#39;d probably look at me, grab me, and then force me to drink the bar mat.  Hmm...I don&#39;t think that would be a bad idea.  If you&#39;re ever in San Pedro Square and need a drink, then head on over to Market Beer!  With a great amount of beers to pick and top-notch service, Market Beer will make you &#34;hops&#34; for joy!  LULZZ  ZZZZZz~@!  
                  This is one of the main reasons why I am uber obsessed with San Pedro Square Market. The Market Beer Co is for all types of beer lovers. The boyfriend and I make it a ritual to try all the exclusive IPAs that they carry. It is so awesome that they always carry at least 5 different kind of Lagunitas. Not only do they have bottled beer, but they also have a rotating beer tap. The staff there is super friendly, awesome, personable, and knowledgeable about their beers. There has never been a time when I was disappointed with one of their beer suggestions. I also appreciate how they have TVs right in the bar area, which is perfect for watching all the games. Overall, if you&#39;re in SPSM and craving a tall cold one then don&#39;t hesitate to stop by the Market Beer Co!  
                  I really don&#39;t know that much about beer, but all I knew is that I was thirsty. Me and my friend came here after devouring our burgers from Konjoe, so we were in the mood for something fruity and refreshing. We stared at the wide assortment of bottled beers lining the wall and I guess we looked confused, because one of the guys quickly came over to help us out. He asked us what kind of flavors we liked and explained how each beer was categorized. He helped us narrow it down to a delicious raspberry beer. He opened the bottle and split them into cups for us. I believe it was around $13 for 2 full glasses- such a good deal. My friend and I had our hands full with leftover boxes of food, and he even offered to carry our beers out to a table for us. I guess chivalry isn&#39;t dead! haha.  I really enjoyed my beer, and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had anything like it. It had such good flavor, and I&#39;m glad he recommended it to us. I&#39;d like to come back to try their other beers and to check out the ones they have on tap, as well.  
                  Had a very great experience with these guys. I walked up to the bar and started chatting them up about what kind of beer I was looking for. They excitedly ran over to the fridge and picked out one of their favorite IPAs. It was delicious and exactly what I was looking for.   As they mostly sell 22oz microbrews, the price per volume is very low! My girl and I split a bottle and it was $11!  
                  Great place to chill with friends, relax, and of course have a drink. You can find seats inside or outside especially on a nice cool evening can be really nice! Good amount TVs around so you can watch whatever game it is that is on. Many great eatery around the square. First time here and definitely not the last. Most food places accept credit card so no worries!   Parking: They validate so you can park at the garage across the street.   The ice cream truck lets you sing for ice cream or for $1. A lot of people actually sing and it creates a really dynamic and fun atmosphere.   Check this place out! I will definitely come back again!  
                  Plenty of great beers to choose from.  Noticed a few that are not often found here in the south bay.  Their price is a bit on the high side however it is in line with their neighbors selling food.  Do not know what Puneet A.&#39;s problem is.  Proper glass ware has a huge effect on what your senses detect in beer and wine!  
                  First of all, San Pedro Square market is a gem in DTSJ. Our experience wouldn&#39;t be the same without Market Beer Co, though. Located in the building on the other side of the courtyard, conveniently across the way from Bray, Market Beer Co has never disappointed. They have a huge selection of craft beers in floor to ceiling coolers with a simple standing wooden counter in front of them and a register on the side. There have been two super helpful guys behind the register every time we go and they always give GREAT recs.  
                  This place is very good and I would love to give 5 stars but they&#39;re a little pricey. The great thing is that they have so many great beers and you can enjoy your beer anywhere in SPSM. I don&#39;t think they had beers on tap when they first opened but they do now.  The guys who work here are always friendly and helpful. They have an excellent variety of great beer. Did I mention great beer? I had a superb beer on tap that I would like to mention but there&#39;s not much of it so I can&#39;t tell you which one it is because I want more for myself. It&#39;s probably something you&#39;ve never seen before. Thank you to that guy who gave that sample a few day ago!  
                  Awesome selection of bottled beers ( almost all larger bottles ), and a decent assortment of taps that changes often.  They carry both a huge number of local brews and a well-curated assortment of stuff from all over the world, all properly stored in a huge chilled case.  They guys working the taps were friendly, fast and helpful, and our glass of Dogfish Head Namaste was delicious.  I&#39;d say the prices for pints are quite reasonable, but as far as bottles go, they aren&#39;t really competing well with prices you&#39;d find in an upmarket liquor store.  They don&#39;t have food, but they do encourage you to go to one of the many other stalls in the market for something with your beer.  There&#39;s some number of tall tables associated with the stall, or you can go to the communal seating in the center of the market.  This would definitely be my go-to place for a drink in San Pedro square.  Note that they - like most downtown merchants - happily validate parking in the city garages.  
                  What can I say. I can get different craft beers here and they all usually have descriptions attached to them. If you dont know what brewsky you want you can ask Bro Nameth, Marco Brolo or Bro Jackson at the register. Litterally the dudes who work here as SUPER COOL and SUPER HELPFUL. If you cant decide just ask them, and they ask you some questions like what flavors and what beers you currently like, if you like light or dark and taste wise. One guy even let me taste some of the beers on tap to see if I liked a certain kind before making a purchase!   What a great place right at SPMS!  
                  Everything has a Rate Beer description so I suggest reading them on any beer you are not familiar with. Jake has assembled a HUGE selection too! Remember to &#34;Like&#34; them on Facebook to keep up on the events they post.  I&#39;ve only ever spoke with Awesome Austin and Jake but these two create such a killer vibe around such a small shared market space. They are both knowledgeable about every product on hand and the selections on tap are super fresh.  Visit the other vendors around the market as well. There is some killer food to be had there!  
                  Great beers and great service.   I&#39;m a huge fan of the Beer Co. I&#39;ve been there countless numbers of time and have never walked away feeling anything less than happy and excited.   The taps are always rotating and always fresh with new styles.   Really happy this place won the most bitter bar in California! (Stone&#39;s competition to see which bars drink the most hoppy deliciousness).   Jake, Austin, Carl, and TJ are legit beer gurus. I&#39;ve learned so much from them.   Overall synopsis: good beer and good people. Definitely one of my favorite places in SJ.  
                  This is one that can be summed up in just a few words: when you just wanna grab a beer...  5 stars for no bull. Quick and simple, in and out. Though I still haven&#39;t quite figured out the organization yet. Maybe by name/ type/ quality? I dunno. If I gave it a few minutes or asked someone, I&#39;m sure it&#39;d be pretty clear. Great selection of craft beers though!  
                  The SPSM just keeps getting better..  With the opening of the Market Beer Co came wonderland for my tastebuds. This spot has got the best selection of craft beers in a location where you are actually allowed to pop open your bottle and walk around the market freely, enjoying your selection. Jake has been such an asset in helping me find the right beer for my mood each time I stop by, and is always happy to throw in a little beer knowledge when I check out.  Although yes, the prices are more than your&#39;e going to pay for the bud light around the corner; it is after all... a craft beer store, bringing the wide selection of upscale beers in HUGE bottles, so I can&#39;t say that the prices aren&#39;t justified. They even give ratings and descriptions for each beer so that if you&#39;re feeling particularly bold, you can pick one out without the help of a beer guru by your side.  With that said, not only do I appreciate the continued help of these experts, but the beers they bring to the market. Why wouldn&#39;t you make this your go-to beer stop?  
                  Great selection, friendly staff. Enjoyed a nice Pliny, The Elder on the patio the other day.   Updated: 5/10/13 - Corkage fee is gone, and they just added several beers on tap today. Do these guys a favor and come enjoy some great beer.
