                  *If you love Bloody Mary&#39;s - come try one here!!! *The hot sauce I picked was: professor Payne indeass&#39;s Flamin Flatulence butt blazin recipe #5 - the heck!! ;)  *Awesome, friendly staff - thanks Carlos for making a great drink!  *the Bloody Mary bar is ONLY on Saturday and Sundays. Plan it right and get in here!  
                  It&#39;s one of the bars in the San Pedro Square Market.  Almost hardly noticeable, it&#39;s located near the former garage of San Pedro Square Market past the hot dog place.  They mostly serve beer here.  The selection isn&#39;t the best, but it&#39;s typically quicker than the other bars in San Pedro.  That being said, it&#39;s still pretty dang slow and the service is pretty meh.  Sometimes it&#39;s hard to get their attention.  It is pretty cool when they hold events here, but expect an even busier crowd if they do.  
                  Great side bar when The Market Bar is packed.   Atmosphere is awesome here.  We watched the 2014 world series here and the place was full.   Sometimes they have live music too.  One note...  There is this one female bartender who always seems to be in a bad mood.  Almost like she has been dumped by her boyfriend right before she came to work.   I imagine she is stuck in groundhogs day and has to go to work after being dumped every shift.   In 45 mins I have seen her turn down patrons for free water and sell bottled water.  Meanwhile her male coworker gave out water for free in a glass.   I have seen her state &#34;I&#39;m busy&#34;  when asked a question while making a drink.   She always makes sure to stare through you because she is clearly upset with the way her life has panned out.     Miss dark haired female bartender I hope that dark cloud over your head dissipates so you can make more in tips and be happy.  Worst case...go eat a pizza or ice cream or what ever makes you smile.  
                  Haven&#39;t been going here as much lately....the parking validation situation always seemed to be confusingly changing and trivia night started limiting the number of teams.  My team gave up despite being long time patrons because we had to get there at 5 pm for 7 pm trivia in order to get a table...SPSM lost some loyal customers, but it likely doesn&#39;t matter much in the grand scheme of things I guess.  Still kind of a bummer.  ...sadface.  Still good, but...not as good as it used to be. Now it is just okay.  
                  Nice bar area with patio space outside...good place to sit and shoot the breeze with some friends (or coworkers, in my case).  We actually showed up a couple of times now for Monday night trivia.  We learned that we are apparently not great at trivia, but the place itself was comfortable and the employees were helpful in getting us a table and chairs when we arrived late the first time and found nothing open.  Feel free to grab a drink here or peruse the rest of the market and bring back food and drinks of your choice.  
                  Unique atmosphere, good drinks, and an awesome crowd of people are just some of the things I enjoy about Garage Bar.  I visited here last weekend with my husband (needed a break from the kids) and we had a wonderful time. If you didn&#39;t guess already the bar is located inside of a giant garage or to be more accurate it was probably an old wearhouse, not too sure. The industrial vibe from this place comes from the cement floor, brick walls, and steel beams/piping that run along the ceiling, it&#39;s actually a really awesome interior for a bar. There is also plenty of open space and seating as well.  My husband ordered his usual favorite craft beers, while I decided to try the bloody marry and boy was it good! It had the perfect amount of salt, spices, and toppings to munch on; I treated it almost like a meal instead of a drink lol. The prices here are very reasonable, maybe a bit more expensive than some other local bars, but your also paying for the service, atmosphere, and great crowd here!  We are definitely thinking of getting a group together one weekend and stopping by again!  
                  I spent NYE at the garage bar and they did a great job!!! They had a great bash equipped with a photo booth, free champagne at midnight, and good jams! They also had themed cocktails for 5 bucks a pop.  I usually come to this venue to grab a drink at b2 so it was cool to see the bar transform into a playground where all the night crawlers come to play! I&#39;m definitely a regular at San Pedro&#39;s because free parking with validation (2hrs) and endless choices of quick, quality food.   Also a plus--the pizza place usually is open the latest so grab a mid-nightout snack!!!  
                  Drinks are alright. Okay pricing too. I always get James and ginger, which they use real ginger beer, hell yasss! The service is friendly and they get to you in a timely matter.  
                  LOVE LOVE LOVE!  This place is where they host Brainstormer trivia every Monday evening. They also have live music on Friday and Saturday nights (HOW AMAZEBALLZ IS THAT)?!? It is a wonderful open space with a bar and a coffee shop and will generally have whatever game of the moment is hot on the big screen projector. The servers are all really great and the staff is super friendly and on top of keeping the place clean.   This is a place for all ages. You will see families with youngsters, young adults partying, people with their puppies (YES PUPPIES), and even people like your parents and grandparents. Does this eclectic mix kill the vibe, ABSOLUTELY NOT!  Brian runs a tight ship and keeps this place fresh, clean, reasonably priced, and FUN!  You may or may not see me there on a weekly basis :)  
                  Whyyyy is nobody ever working here?? Took me 3 Sundays to try this place out for the Bloody Marys! Minus 1 star for lack of service!  Other than that, their Build Your Own Bloody Mary bar is awesome (Sundays only, I think). They offer a wide variety of vodkas, hot sauces, and garnishes to accompany your drink. Since I love my BMs spicy, of course I picked a jalapeno vodka and then asked the bartender to stuff it with a bit of everything. I don&#39;t think he was exactly thrilled about that..but hey if this thing is gonna cost $12 then I want it ALL! Our drink ended up containing: BACON, olives, tomato, peppercini, pickled carrots, pickled green beans, celery, and pickled asparagus. This drink was delicious and was pretty much breakfast in a cup. Looking forward to coming back as long as there&#39;s someone working!  P.S. The bartender was right, you really haven&#39;t lived life until you&#39;ve tried a pickled green bean! Currently on the hunt to buy a jar for myself. :)  
                  It&#39;s basically an extention of the San Pedro Square Market Bar. They both have the same menu--I know this because my boyfriend and I order off the wine and beer list enough to recognize all the names and the familiar font. Regardless of that, it&#39;s the same great service, and same great drinks with less noise and more room. I think the atmosphere on this end is even better with the large open garage area and the patio that extends out closer to the street.  There&#39;s always security wandering around, making sure people feel safe. Altogether, this definitely made our evening peaceful and enjoyable.  
                  Great place for Sunday morning bloody Mary&#39;s! They make them exactly to your liking and they&#39;re decently priced. The bacon salted rim is the best.  
                  Here&#39;s a philosophical question. If I don&#39;t remember embarrassing myself here, did it really happen?   From what I can remember, this was a good bar with decent drinks and interesting people. Though I could just be making it all up. I don&#39;t know. That last phrase about sums up my entire night here.  
                  While saving a booth for my husband and our friends I was checking out Garage Bar. They have two big tvs on each side of the small bar which kind of draws you in. There was one bartender but it didn&#39;t seem all that busy. When my husband came back without a drink I jumped up and ordered a Stella and Shock Top. Hardly any wait time and was back at my table within minutes.   The beers are $6 a piece which is pretty reasonable. Maybe next time I&#39;ll try one of the whiskeys or mixed drinks.   Great quick bar with a friendly bartender.  
                  Cheers...at last there&#39;s another watering hole option at San Pedro Sq Market! No more standing knee deep in the happy hour hoopla waiting 20 mins for a tall, cool one at the always under-staffed main bar.  Just 20 paces back in the warehouse portion lies the newly permitted Garage Bar featuring a respectable selection of whiskey, bourbon, scotch like Four Roses Single Barrel, EH Taylor, Macallan 15 yr.  Nice touch too is they&#39;re featuring some new fangled local artisanal efforts like St. George Absinthe &amp; Old World Spirit&#39;s Goldrun Rye.  Beer-wise, they&#39;re pouring about 7 crafts brews including my fav Great White from Lost Coast Brewery in Eureka and the selection differs from the main bar.  I&#39;m holding onto my 4th star until they up the anty by beefing up the brown spirit offerings with some harder-to-find bourbons as is my understanding.  But in the meantime, this is an excellent addition to the ever growing list of worthy purveyors at SPSM!  
                  Recently had the pleasure of stumbling across their Bloody Mary bar a few weekends ago. You get to choose the degree of spice, type of salt on the rim of your glass, your vodka, and what veggies you want as garnish! The mix they use is phenomenal!  Bartender makes the mix himself in the morning and keeps the bar open until he runs out of mix. Can&#39;t wait to get back there on another weekend morning!  
                  The concept is easy enough:  Get a warehouse space. Fill it with whiskey and appropriate non-Bud Light brews on draft. Have someone serving that actually knows what they&#39;re talking about. Then, success.  Good open space that&#39;s a little industrial than intimate, despite the sheer amount of biergarten lights littered throughout. But at such reasonable prices, who cares?  Simply put: Great place to enjoy cheap quality drinks without having to fight for elbow space.  
                  This place has a build-your-own bloody mary bar every Sunday. They have flavored vodkas to mix in your Bloody Mary (chipotle, cucumber, citron, pepper, etc) and all sorts of fun garnishes from-everything from olives to bacon.  Best in town!

Nice touch too is they&#39;re featuring some new fangled local artisanal efforts like St. George Absinthe &amp; Old World Spirit&#39;s Goldrun Rye.  Beer-wise, they&#39;re pouring about 7 crafts brews including my fav Great White from Lost Coast Brewery in Eureka and the selection differs from the main bar.  I&#39;m holding onto my 4th star until they up the anty by beefing up the brown spirit offerings with some harder-to-find bourbons as is my understanding.  But in the meantime, this is an excellent addition to the ever growing list of worthy purveyors at SPSM!  
                  Recently had the pleasure of stumbling across their Bloody Mary bar a few weekends ago. You get to choose the degree of spice, type of salt on the rim of your glass, your vodka, and what veggies you want as garnish! The mix they use is phenomenal!  Bartender makes the mix himself in the morning and keeps the bar open until he runs out of mix. Can&#39;t wait to get back there on another weekend morning!  
                  The concept is easy enough:  Get a warehouse space. Fill it with whiskey and appropriate non-Bud Light brews on draft. Have someone serving that actually knows what they&#39;re talking about. Then, success.  Good open space that&#39;s a little industrial than intimate, despite the sheer amount of biergarten lights littered throughout. But at such reasonable prices, who cares?  Simply put: Great place to enjoy cheap quality drinks without having to fight for elbow space.  
                  This place has a build-your-own bloody mary bar every Sunday. They have flavored vodkas to mix in your Bloody Mary (chipotle, cucumber, citron, pepper, etc) and all sorts of fun garnishes from-everything from olives to bacon.  Best in town!  
                  *If you love Bloody Mary&#39;s - come try one here!!! *The hot sauce I picked was: professor Payne indeass&#39;s Flamin Flatulence butt blazin recipe #5 - the heck!! ;)  *Awesome, friendly staff - thanks Carlos for making a great drink!  *the Bloody Mary bar is ONLY on Saturday and Sundays. Plan it right and get in here!  
                  It&#39;s one of the bars in the San Pedro Square Market.  Almost hardly noticeable, it&#39;s located near the former garage of San Pedro Square Market past the hot dog place.  They mostly serve beer here.  The selection isn&#39;t the best, but it&#39;s typically quicker than the other bars in San Pedro.  That being said, it&#39;s still pretty dang slow and the service is pretty meh.  Sometimes it&#39;s hard to get their attention.  It is pretty cool when they hold events here, but expect an even busier crowd if they do.  
                  Great side bar when The Market Bar is packed.   Atmosphere is awesome here.  We watched the 2014 world series here and the place was full.   Sometimes they have live music too.  One note...  There is this one female bartender who always seems to be in a bad mood.  Almost like she has been dumped by her boyfriend right before she came to work.   I imagine she is stuck in groundhogs day and has to go to work after being dumped every shift.   In 45 mins I have seen her turn down patrons for free water and sell bottled water.  Meanwhile her male coworker gave out water for free in a glass.   I have seen her state &#34;I&#39;m busy&#34;  when asked a question while making a drink.   She always makes sure to stare through you because she is clearly upset with the way her life has panned out.     Miss dark haired female bartender I hope that dark cloud over your head dissipates so you can make more in tips and be happy.  Worst case...go eat a pizza or ice cream or what ever makes you smile.  
                  Haven&#39;t been going here as much lately....the parking validation situation always seemed to be confusingly changing and trivia night started limiting the number of teams.  My team gave up despite being long time patrons because we had to get there at 5 pm for 7 pm trivia in order to get a table...SPSM lost some loyal customers, but it likely doesn&#39;t matter much in the grand scheme of things I guess.  Still kind of a bummer.  ...sadface.  Still good, but...not as good as it used to be. Now it is just okay.  
                  Nice bar area with patio space outside...good place to sit and shoot the breeze with some friends (or coworkers, in my case).  We actually showed up a couple of times now for Monday night trivia.  We learned that we are apparently not great at trivia, but the place itself was comfortable and the employees were helpful in getting us a table and chairs when we arrived late the first time and found nothing open.  Feel free to grab a drink here or peruse the rest of the market and bring back food and drinks of your choice.  
                  Unique atmosphere, good drinks, and an awesome crowd of people are just some of the things I enjoy about Garage Bar.  I visited here last weekend with my husband (needed a break from the kids) and we had a wonderful time. If you didn&#39;t guess already the bar is located inside of a giant garage or to be more accurate it was probably an old wearhouse, not too sure. The industrial vibe from this place comes from the cement floor, brick walls, and steel beams/piping that run along the ceiling, it&#39;s actually a really awesome interior for a bar. There is also plenty of open space and seating as well.  My husband ordered his usual favorite craft beers, while I decided to try the bloody marry and boy was it good! It had the perfect amount of salt, spices, and toppings to munch on; I treated it almost like a meal instead of a drink lol. The prices here are very reasonable, maybe a bit more expensive than some other local bars, but your also paying for the service, atmosphere, and great crowd here!  We are definitely thinking of getting a group together one weekend and stopping by again!  
                  I spent NYE at the garage bar and they did a great job!!! They had a great bash equipped with a photo booth, free champagne at midnight, and good jams! They also had themed cocktails for 5 bucks a pop.  I usually come to this venue to grab a drink at b2 so it was cool to see the bar transform into a playground where all the night crawlers come to play! I&#39;m definitely a regular at San Pedro&#39;s because free parking with validation (2hrs) and endless choices of quick, quality food.   Also a plus--the pizza place usually is open the latest so grab a mid-nightout snack!!!  
                  Drinks are alright. Okay pricing too. I always get James and ginger, which they use real ginger beer, hell yasss! The service is friendly and they get to you in a timely matter.  
                  LOVE LOVE LOVE!  This place is where they host Brainstormer trivia every Monday evening. They also have live music on Friday and Saturday nights (HOW AMAZEBALLZ IS THAT)?!? It is a wonderful open space with a bar and a coffee shop and will generally have whatever game of the moment is hot on the big screen projector. The servers are all really great and the staff is super friendly and on top of keeping the place clean.   This is a place for all ages. You will see families with youngsters, young adults partying, people with their puppies (YES PUPPIES), and even people like your parents and grandparents. Does this eclectic mix kill the vibe, ABSOLUTELY NOT!  Brian runs a tight ship and keeps this place fresh, clean, reasonably priced, and FUN!  You may or may not see me there on a weekly basis :)  
                  Whyyyy is nobody ever working here?? Took me 3 Sundays to try this place out for the Bloody Marys! Minus 1 star for lack of service!  Other than that, their Build Your Own Bloody Mary bar is awesome (Sundays only, I think). They offer a wide variety of vodkas, hot sauces, and garnishes to accompany your drink. Since I love my BMs spicy, of course I picked a jalapeno vodka and then asked the bartender to stuff it with a bit of everything. I don&#39;t think he was exactly thrilled about that..but hey if this thing is gonna cost $12 then I want it ALL! Our drink ended up containing: BACON, olives, tomato, peppercini, pickled carrots, pickled green beans, celery, and pickled asparagus. This drink was delicious and was pretty much breakfast in a cup. Looking forward to coming back as long as there&#39;s someone working!  P.S. The bartender was right, you really haven&#39;t lived life until you&#39;ve tried a pickled green bean! Currently on the hunt to buy a jar for myself. :)  
                  It&#39;s basically an extention of the San Pedro Square Market Bar. They both have the same menu--I know this because my boyfriend and I order off the wine and beer list enough to recognize all the names and the familiar font. Regardless of that, it&#39;s the same great service, and same great drinks with less noise and more room. I think the atmosphere on this end is even better with the large open garage area and the patio that extends out closer to the street.  There&#39;s always security wandering around, making sure people feel safe. Altogether, this definitely made our evening peaceful and enjoyable.  
                  Great place for Sunday morning bloody Mary&#39;s! They make them exactly to your liking and they&#39;re decently priced. The bacon salted rim is the best.  
                  Here&#39;s a philosophical question. If I don&#39;t remember embarrassing myself here, did it really happen?   From what I can remember, this was a good bar with decent drinks and interesting people. Though I could just be making it all up. I don&#39;t know. That last phrase about sums up my entire night here.  
                  While saving a booth for my husband and our friends I was checking out Garage Bar. They have two big tvs on each side of the small bar which kind of draws you in. There was one bartender but it didn&#39;t seem all that busy. When my husband came back without a drink I jumped up and ordered a Stella and Shock Top. Hardly any wait time and was back at my table within minutes.   The beers are $6 a piece which is pretty reasonable. Maybe next time I&#39;ll try one of the whiskeys or mixed drinks.   Great quick bar with a friendly bartender.  
                  Cheers...at last there&#39;s another watering hole option at San Pedro Sq Market!
