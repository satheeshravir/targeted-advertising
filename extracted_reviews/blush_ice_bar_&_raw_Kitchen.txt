                  Blush has the Best Happy Hour  Rose roll - yummy! I always ask for extra sauce $5 Fondue -  cute little platter :) I LOVE cheese.     $5 Blush - pretty pink vodka mix drink X2 or 3 lol   $5                                                                                                                                     Total $25  
                  Meh, their sushi and oysters are mediocre. I do enjoy their Blush drink (pretty heavy on the alcohol - I&#39;m lightweight) though.   I&#39;ve been here a total of five times and each time, the service continues to lack. However, it&#39;s definitely a good place to grab drinks and socialize with friends. I love the atmosphere and the ambiance!  
                  Great ambiance for couples.   -Drinks: lots of cocktails at a great size with great taste. I Had the KiWi Punch and it was delicious. -sushi: rice is a little over done or too much moisture sticking to my teeth sticky.  But great flavor for Singapore and Mango Ceviche! -Oysters: fresh no fishy smell and we had two of each kind and all the sauces is just enough.   Not bad for a fancy night out for the budget conscious!  Oh yeah and I peek into happy hour menu, wow the price! Definitely come here before a show or a sharks game!  
                  Didn&#39;t go for happy hour but still had a great time on a Friday night. Met up with some friends there after spending forever finding parking since this is part of San Pedro Square Market (that means you can bar hop!). I ordered my first drink as a 21 year old here and it was one of the &#34;Create your own Blushie&#34;. I&#39;m sure any of the Blushies are great but if you&#39;re craving a certain slushie cocktail, this is the place you want to be. They have a variety of alcoholic bases to choose from (like all the fruity vodkas). You then pair that with a slush base (lemon lime, pineapple, or something else I forgot) and any type of puree. My Blushie consisted of peach vodka, lemon lime slush, and strawberry puree and it was delicious! Atmosphere was very chill but people were also dancing and whatnot. It&#39;s a nice place to hang out and chill with friends!  
                  I loOooOoove Blush. Why? Their sushi tacos are freakin&#39; amazing. I&#39;m just sad that they&#39;re so tiny. I could literally eat the taco in like 2 bites. Make them bigger and TAKE MY MONEY!! The trio comes in seared salmon, seared tuna, and a California. Every time I come here, I always get two orders.  When my boyfriend and I ate here, we also ordered the oyster sampler with three different kinds of oysters. They were good and tasted fresh, but of course, these oysters are so freakin&#39; small. :( We also ordered a Philadelphia roll. It was just OK because it kept falling apart.  We&#39;ve never tried the drinks here nor have we came during happy hour. Although we wish we could so we can save a little money every time we eat here, getting off work during traffic hour is terrible.  Overall, this place is a nice spot to chill and eat, since it&#39;s in a huge building filled with other restaurants. To me, this is a place to just grab a snack, though how pricey it can be. But seriously though, get the sushi tacos!  
                  A little overrated IMO. My friend and I got here around opening time, and there was only one employee working. While he was friendly, the food wasn&#39;t as good as I thought it would be. Not really worth the price, unless it&#39;s happy hour. We ordered: -Sushi tacos: good, but not amazing -Sashimi: beautiful presentation, thick pieces -Tropical roll: strawberries added a nice tartness to the roll, yummy! -Singapore roll: I wasn&#39;t aware that it had wasabi aioli, and not being a fan of wasabi, I wasn&#39;t super impressed. The fish tasted nice though. Overall, I would probably come back to try the drinks during happy hour, but I much prefer the other options in San Pedro that provided more food than the $28 price tag.  
                  Came here for happy hour and it was absolutely amazing!!   It&#39;s a small corner of San Pedro Square and it also has its own door. Heads up because there&#39;s a lot of construction around that area and be wary of the detours!   It was my first time coming here but my friend has recommended trying out the happy hour food because the original menu was really pricey. Honestly the happy hour foods was good enough! The fish tacos, hamachi spoons, rose roll, cheese fondue were $5 each and they were so good! Can&#39;t forget the $1 oysters! You have to order a max of 6 which is ok with me. The oysters were a bit small though because one of my oysters were basically in hiding Bc it was that small.....   I also had the Blush drink, not the margarita. It was super good, it had some of the slush in the drink and wow it&#39;s sweet and amazing. I wasn&#39;t too sure if I was supposed to stir it up though but I ended it stirring it up in the end. Still good. I&#39;m definitely going to come back for happy hour!  
                  I love it here!! Amazing happy hour deals ($5 drinks and snacks!).  Some of the prettiest and best tasting drinks! I got the Blush and my friend got the Tropical Isle - both were AMAZING. The drinks are sooo pretty, it&#39;s no wonder that everyone was ordering the same ones. I love how there&#39;s a ball of flavored slush in it too!   I also got the sushi tacos that were also really good. Kind of messy to eat because the tacos are so packed, which can be both good and bad. Even the taco shell was delicious! 2 out of the 3 tacos had a wasabi sauce drizzled on it, but I personally don&#39;t like wasabi and wish it wasn&#39;t on it.  
                  There happy hour is amazing! One of the best I have seen for the price. Very happy I found their happy hour. Their $1 oysters are small but delicious.  
                  This review goes out specifically to our waitress last night, Kianna. This girl deserves every star on this review. I&#39;ve had her multiple times as my waitress and everytime she&#39;s served my friends and I, her service has always been top notch! This girl definitely deserves some recognition because I truly believe that good service makes a huge difference on a girls night out.   She was constantly checking up on our table, happily explained all of the different types of drinks served there (you know how indecisive girls can be) and she explained everything with a smile which I definitely appreciated! I&#39;m not one to usually write reviews but this girl definitely deserves it.  Can&#39;t wait to come back again! :)  
                  The only place I come to Blush is for a quick stop for a shot before I head out somewhere else.  Everything else is okay. The bartender is okay, the ambiance is okay, the people are there are okay. Drinks are okay.  They have pretty decent music sometimes though.  
                  Honestly, with their happy hour prices and the quality of the food and drinks there, I would consider this a 4 star place. But seriously, I have to dock a star because they just cannot get their happy hour straight. Every time I have been to Blush (only 2 though so take my opinion for what it is), I have called the day before hand and confirmed their happy hour times. And then, I show up and ask them if it&#39;s happy hour and they say no and tell me their &#34;actual&#34; happy hour times. What the!?!?! The first time it happened, I figured that it was just an accident but the second time, I was pretty angry. Both times, I stayed and enjoyed the place anyway but I am seriously disappointed in their lack of service and the overall confusion about happy hour.   I believe they card at the entrance Friday/Saturday nights but not at other times. This place is smack in the middle of San Pedro Square inside next to the food court. It&#39;s on the side that doesn&#39;t have the bar so you might have to cross the outside patio to get to it.   The place can get pretty busy during peak times but I&#39;ve never had trouble getting a table here. Service can get slow so it can take a while for orders to come out or to get the attention of a staff member.   As for the food, the oysters are pretty on point although not comparable to freshness of SF or Boston oysters. I&#39;ve had their sushi and assorted Blush drinks as well. As for sushi, I really their rose roll which is spicy tuna, crab, avocado and spicy mayo. It actually has quite a nice kick to it.   I absolutely loooove their Blush drinks. They&#39;re blended well and taste amazing to mask the alcohol well so watch out, you might get tipsy faster than you&#39;d think. They have great pre-made blends but you can also build your own as well! They&#39;re only $5 during happy hour, which is an absolute steal.  
                  Blush is definitely one of my favorite Happy Hour places of all time. I love the fact that I live so close to it. That just makes it more tempting to go, though!   Happy Hours are: 3-6pm on Mon-Fridays 9-11pm on Sun-Thursdays  Their HH menu is definitely to live for. From their sushi tacos to the &#34;blush&#34; drinks, you can just never have enough of anything! Everything is super good.  The only downside is that since they&#39;re always busy, they seem to be understaffed all the time so waiting for someone to take your order or waiting for the food to be handed to you when you see that it&#39;s ready- can take a little while.  However, other than that, I highly suggest this place if you&#39;re either looking for a girls night out over a drink or with friends that are craving sushi!  
                  Amazingly mediocre for a place that looked so interesting.  We came towards the end of happy hour (3-6 on weekdays) to try the food and drinks that looked so appetizing in pictures. Service was a little condescending at first, but you get used to it when you&#39;re 22 and look under the drinking age. The servers could definitely do with a warmer attitude though.  HAMACHI SPOONS &amp; SUSHI TACOS: We had the hamachi spoons and sushi tacos (both $5) as starters. Normally I can write pages on food descriptions, but nothing stood about these. The tacos were essentially fried wonton wrappers filled with either salmon, tuna, or crab salad on top of cabbage. Not much else in terms of seasoning or flavor, and not such high quality fish that they could stand alone. They&#39;re very pretty to look at and they have potential to be great, but they well way short. The hamachi spoons were slightly better due to the ponzu sauce, but again, nothing I&#39;d highly recommend. The portions are tiny, so I definitely wouldn&#39;t pay full price for them.  COCKTAILS: At $5 a pop for cocktails, this is where Blush shines. You can choose from their specialty cocktails or choose to make your own, but we chose to stick to their specials and got a margarita, a Blush (passion fruit vodka, lime juice, and cranberry slush) and a Tropical Isle (Raspberry vodka, Tyku liqueur, and orange juice). Sweet, girly, and fruity, they did the trick. They were surprisingly strong too!  Overall: I&#39;d come back here for happy hour drinks, but I&#39;d definitely pass on the food. Other than happy hour, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d say it&#39;s worth it.  
                  I adore Blush Raw Bar, this place embodies the hipster and lightweight sophisticated vibe all in one, my first visit here was back in 2012, when I was working with a beer distribution company and delivered here, I like the look of the establishment located in the San Pedro Square area of Downtown San Jose. The owners told me more about their aim to provide a great bar with great cocktails and good music to the mostly college crowd that comes to hangout in downtown San Jose, they have suceeded.  This bar is a must visit when I&#39;m in the south bay. For what I look for in entertainment and drinks, Blush has it down packed! The ambiance is very causual yet....upscale. To me it fits the crowd that hangs here, you don&#39;t feel out of place. I like the fact that your well drinks here are still poured with premium spirits. So they are giving you quality cocktails with a still relatively low cost A+ Blush Raw Bar.  In closing, Blush Raw Bar speakes for itself in my opinion. The Dj spinning classic hip hop or downtempo sets the mood here. The drinks are great and the atmosphere is dynamite. I say if you&#39;re in the Downtown San Jose area check it out, if you like it..Yelp about it, even if you don&#39;t, Yelp about it.  
                  The tables were dirty in the lounge area when we arrived and the waitress attempted to wipe it down but she did a pretty sloppy job.  Fondue wasn&#39;t very good. The bread tasted old and the cheese was lumpy. The candle wasn&#39;t doing anything to melt or even keep the cheese warm.  The California roll tasted like something you&#39;d get out of a plastic container at a grocery store.  The oysters sure looked awesome as my Snapchat story but they were not fresh and were on the small size. I only had 1 because I was afraid I&#39;d get sick (I did not, so props to Blush).  Out of all the food I tried, the hamachi spoons were the best. They were simple, not too salty, but not bland.  Overall the food was mediocre but nothing horrific. A simple place to hang out with friends for happy hour and grab a few drinks, but if you&#39;re here just for the food, make sure you set your expectations accordingly.  
                  This is a Great place to hang out.  It is Lounge style dinning.  Happy hour 3pm-6pm is great and the Menu is from $4-$5.  Best of all is $1 oysters.  The Drinks are yummy.  I Love the atmosphere.  This is Must go place to lounge and hang out.  
                  Best HH in DTSJ ever!!! There is literally nothing else that gives you such decent food for such a great price. It helps that their slushie drinks taste so good. They&#39;re all my favorite. I can&#39;t pick just one.  I felt like a king walking into HH and ordering everything off the menu, feeling bloated like a true Yelper, and spending less than $30. The crowd is super friendly too. Everyone around you becomes your best friend when the Warriors win.  
                  Happy hour is Mon-Fri 3 p.m. - 6 p.m. Sun-Wed 9:30 p.m. - 11 p.m.  This is a long overdue review for one of my  favorite places. Blush is located in San Pedro square. This place has a great happy hour, cheap rolls and appetizers and $1 oysters. It gets packed quick because it&#39;s a small place so get here early.  Oysters-super fresh! Always on point. Clean and not gritty. Good with the cocktail sauce and lemon!   All rolls are great but my favorites are the rose roll (Spicy Tuna, Crab, Avocado, Spicy Mayo Sauce), reggae roll (Spicy Salmon, Crab, Lemon, Avocado, Cucumber) and dragon roll ( Shrimp, Unagi, Avocado, Crab, Wonton Chips). Whenever I take people here, the rose roll is always a winner with everyone! Great flavor.   Blush-on happy hour these things are $5! SO WORTH IT!!! The original signature Blush is always great if it&#39;s your first time here and it&#39;s always pleasing to look at (that cute pink sugar rim!!!!). My favorite however is the tropical aisle, it&#39;s a little more citrusy, yum!  
                  Such a cute place! Came here during happy hour (around 4pm) on a Friday. How could anyone pass up a deal for $1 oysters and $5 drinks?   Blush is in San Pedro Square, and my friend and I found free street parking right next to it! The only bad thing I would hate to comment about is the slow service. My friend had to ask twice to have our orders even taken, but I enjoyed the food and drinks so much that I didn&#39;t really mind.  The place was pretty crowded, but it&#39;s a pretty nice place to visit during happy hour. I love their vibe and their setup.   Their $1 happy hour Chesapeake oysters were delicious and came with 3 different dipping sauces. Their &#34;blush&#34; drink ($5 during happy hour) was well-made as well.   Would definitely recommend this as a place to catch up with an old friend or a place to stop by for happy hour!  EDIT: Came here again on Christmas Eve. And I have to say, Blush does not disappoint. Their happy hour drinks that we got - &#34;Tropical Isle&#34; and &#34;Blush&#34; were quite a bang for their buck. They were delicious, effective, and aesthetically pleasing. We got good service as well!  
                  Whenever I feel like I want to go back in time and re-live my 2010 days, I head to Blush Lounge. This place has not changed at all since they first opened, from the decor to their mundane menu. I appreciated this establishment when it first opened cause they had the best HH in town. They still have their good HH specials, but nothing has changed whatsoever on their menu.   I get that they don&#39;t have a full kitchen so they&#39;re limited as to what they can serve, but the owners should try to put some thought and consideration into revamping their menu a little. Also, they really need to find a new supplier of oysters because the last few times I&#39;ve had it, they were too big and milky.   One thing I definitely recommend are the cookies at chocatoo right behind their booths for their delicious cookies.  
                  I love love love this place!! Amazing for happy hour!! My friends and I literally get everything on their happy hour menu! So cheap and yummy. I always get their original blush, but the lychee one is sweeter. Love all their rolls, very unique. I come here for their $1 oysters and amazing appetizers. You can&#39;t go wrong with any of their happy hour items.  
                  The blush cocktails here are sweet and delicious, strong enough and still tastes good. The food is quite expensive and not really worth it. I would come here only for cocktails and maybe a tiny snack, but not if you&#39;re looking for bigger bites and portions.  
                  Blush Lounge is located on the side of San Pedro Market Square and they have their own indoor and outdoor seating areas.  There are outdoor heaters and TV&#39;s outside which is a plus if you&#39;re going to watch a basketball or football game.  The atmosphere is nice and everyone that was working while we were there were nice and accommodating with our group ( we had a group of 8-9 people that weren&#39;t all there yet when seated ).  The only minus was that the bartender was really slow and we received the drinks to our table pretty slowly. A HUGE plus that I liked, however, is they let us bring in food and drinks from the food court area next to the lounge with no issues at all.  I&#39;ve tried their sushi tacos, hamachi shots, oysters, and several of their rolls.  I have to say their sushi tacos and their hamachi shots were my favorite in the area, and everything tasted flavorful and fresh.  Their happy hour menu and prices are definitely worth going to as well. I also tried their fondue appetizer.  When served right away, the cheese has a really good flavor to is, but as it cools it definitely has a very strong and distinct taste. So if you&#39;re ordering their fondue, you better be ready to chomp it all down when served right away!  They have all the typical shots/drinks but if you want to try a specialty cocktail, I definitely recommend you to try their signature blush drink.    Overall, if you&#39;re looking for somewhere to go in downtown that&#39;s a fun yet chill atmosphere with good drinks/Asian fusion small bites, Blush is definitely worth trying.  Definitely recommend their happy hour!  
                  Tried several small plates and liked what each one brought to the table!   Their trio tacos, hamachi spoons, caprese, and fondue were delectable!   This was a great place to grab a drink and have small chat over a few appetizers with some friends.   And their happy hour prices were great!!   I&#39;ll be sure to come back soon!  
                  I can&#39;t believe that I haven&#39;t reviewed this place. I came here a few months ago before a concert at the SAP (really HP to me, but technically they changed it to SAP, so fine) for some drinks and some quick bites. This was a Sunday afternoon, so the place was busy, but we found seats right away even though we were a big group. The best thing about this place is the drinks. Good lawd, those slushy drinks. So good. They are so yummy. I think we each ordered about two or three and some in different flavors. And we all ended up tasting each other&#39;s, and all of them were just as good as the others. I don&#39;t even remember the food that much. I know it wasn&#39;t bad, but it wasn&#39;t the most top notch sushi. However, I don&#39;t think that people go there to eat the best of the best sushi. You go for the drinks, and then you get hungry, so you order some food. So, do it. Go for the drinks and then order some food when those slushy drinks have you feeling just right. 4 stars.  
                  I feel like I always forget to check in whenever I come to blush..which is such a shame because I should be a regular by now. But my review goes to their happy hour (3-6pm M-F)! One of my favorites. The $1 oysters, the rose roll, and the sushi tacos are my go-to orders. Everything about these menu items makes me a happy camper.   It&#39;s all surprisingly filling and tasty. And the presentation of each of these dishes is so aesthetically pleasing. And the servers are so personable.   The seating arrangements of this section in San Pedro are very modern and they make me feel like a cool cat whenever I dine here. So if you&#39;re looking for a semi-fancy feast, please check em out.  
                  Those little tacos are just great. I can&#39;t get enough of them. i also tried the poke bowl last week and found out that i have a new favorite dish. The only downside is the lounge area seats. I&#39;m a tall guy and wish the tables were a bit taller.  
                  Apparently I missed the memo because it seems like everyone comes here for HH. Regardless, it&#39;s a cool and upscale place to come hang out and grab a drink. It&#39;s inside San Pedro Square so there are plenty of options to grab food if you don&#39;t want the the food that they serve here.  I got the Sangria Blushie which I thought was just okay. I might have just picked the wrong one since they have so many other interested drink flavors. They have a bar area where you can drink at and also a small lounge area as well. Prices are a little on the high side, though it seems a lot more affordable during HH.  Overall, I would come back... the food looks good and I want to try a different drink.  
                  Not too impressed with this place. I would give it 2 stars but the fish was pretty fresh and the Happy Hour saved it There are way better sushi places in San Jose that&#39;s more authentic and not as upscale for a better price.   We wanted to check out their happy hour menu ( which I would say is 50/50 meh in my opinion but I&#39;ll get to that later). First, we called in to check if it&#39;s still Happy Hour and a girl answered the phone. This was around 9:15PM and the restaurant was supposed to be open until 11PM. She told us they&#39;re  closing the restaurant early tonight and they&#39;re taking last orders right now. We got off the phone and was like.... uhhh ok.... What kind of restaurants just closes 2 hours early. I was really annoyed at this and decided to call them again about 20 minutes later and a guy picked up and he said the restaurant is still open and will be taking orders until 10:30.... -______-  OK WHAT.   The happy hour is ok. I&#39;d say that the selections are limited but there are some pretty good deals. The $1 oysters and fish tacos were pretty good!  I also enjoyed the Hamachi spoons! The portions are a bit on the smaller side. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d come to this place for a meal during regular hours.  OH THEIR SIGNATURE BLUSH COCKTAIL. I LOVE.  
                  Happy hour.  A good California roll and a rose roll.  Both at a good price and both are hitting the right spot.  I&#39;m sitting at the bar watching a basketball ball game. This is a good meal at a good price.  
                  Not sure why this place is so critically reviewed! The ambience is fun, prices are cheap for happy hour foods and drinks are girly/tasty! You cannot complain about this place when the prices are so fair. My -1 star is due to the fact that it took me forever to get attention from servers when I was trying to pay for my meal. It was empty but the server just never checked in on me. I&#39;ve been here a handful of times &amp; have tried pretty much everything off the happy hour menu including the sushi tacos, the cheese fondue, oysters, &amp; of course their blush drinks. The drinks are fun and refreshing &amp; you can customize your flavors. They have an outdoor dining lounge area with outdoor heaters &amp; an open indoor area that opens into the cafeteria area of San Pedro. It&#39;s a great place for afterwork drinks/food because the ambience is young/hip.  
                  I went to blush on a Friday night it was not what I was expecting but in a good way! They have an outside/ patio where you can sit and enjoy with friends.   They have this really tasty slushy drinks and honestly it tasted better than swirls in my opinion and was just the right amount of alcohol. I got the sangria slushy!  The host / waitress was kind of upset that we weren&#39;t ordering much at first but not everyone had arrived so we were taking it slow. Once everyone was there we were ordering ton of more drinks and shots so it was just irritating that she thought weren&#39;t going to get that much... Oh well.   Besides that perfect for summer nights ! And totally chill atmosphere. No need to wear clubbing attire just dress casual cute :)  
                  One of my fav happy hour places I&#39;ve ever been to! They have amazing selections for only $5 each! And their drinks were also $5. I love how cute and colorful their drinks are and pretty sweet for those who hate strong taste of alcohol like me lol  We ordered the hamachi spoon, sushi taco (AMAZINGGG!!!), oysters, and the rose roll. The portions are not the greatest so dont come here starving because you wont be full lol  The ambiance is nice and dark with loungy feels to it. I always want to dress up everytime I come here :)  
                  Happy hour - Mon-Fri 3:00 pm - 6:00 pm Sun-Wed 9:30 pm - 11:00 pm  To be honest, I only come here for their happy hour. Items on the HH menu are all $5 and oysters are $1 each. Great deal! (Rose roll &amp; hamachi spoons are a must.)  However, they really need to work on their service/ be more knowledgeable about items on their menu. Asked one the servers, didn&#39;t get her name but she was blonde haired, what&#39;s the difference between chesapeake and fanny bay and she responded with &#34;just the size.&#34; Asked her again mentioning in terms of taste and she rudely made the same response. Oysters are not created equal. )= One can taste brinier, sweeter, or saltier than the other.  I always find myself coming back to this place because their HH deal is awesome but their servers are lacking. Shout out to one of the guys behind the sushi bar. He was full of smiles and gave great recommendations!  
                  They have late night happy hour starting at 9PM from Sunday to Thursday.  Hamachi sppons are DELCIOUS!!! No more having to go to Alexander&#39;s for them and they were only $5!!!   BOOM!!!  Next time I will skip dinner and order all the sushi off the menu.  Everything looked so good, but I was full from an earlier dinner.  
                  I really like the Blush Raw Bar Lounge Happy Hour. The cocktail (Make your own Blush) is very tasty and great atmosphere. My recommend for hh is $1 Oyster, $4 California roll, $5 Fondue.  Hamachi spoon and Tacos are just okay.  
                  I came here for happy hour with my coworkers. When we arrived around 5 PM, it was pretty packed however we found outside seating fairly quickly. Our waitress was new, but she was super friendly and quick to answer any questions we had.  We ordered the rose roll, California roll, the sushi tacos, the hamachi spoons, a couple of blushes, and a couple of glasses of red wine! I believe the food dishes were $5 each as well as the blushes and wine (not 100% sure). I really wanted the lychee blush, but it wasn&#39;t included on the happy hour menu so I opted for the blushie instead. The waitress was nice enough to bring some lychees for me to put in the blushie! Super sweet of her! The food was decent definitely not authentic sushi-tasting but it&#39;s cheap and good to munch on.  The service definitely has improved from before. I remember coming here a year ago and the waitresses barely came by to check if you needed anything, but the waitresses working were very attentive to all of the tables.  
                  Came here for Dinner #2 because the first place sucked. Luckily, we were able to grab a table by the bar but from the looks of it, during the peak hours on a Friday night, it looks close to impossible to getting a table for larger than 2 people. Very small little section at San Pedro Square, but hipster and modern atmosphere. The food is decent, a little on the pricey side. Ordered the half dozen raw oysters, Oyster Rockefeller, and Steak Tataki Nigiri. Sadly, I think the raw oysters were the best of the three. The Oyster Rockefeller was disgusting in my opinion, only because it was the first I had it and I was not a fan of that spinach stuff on top, plus it was hot. The Tataki Nigiri wasn&#39;t anything special. The steak actually fell off the top so I basically ate the rice and steak separately.   I think I will just stick to drinks next time. I do love their BYOB - Build your own blushie! :) Note: Happy hour food may be worth a shot if you do want food from here.  
                  Honestly this place is a 4-5 star place. My girlfriend and I love the food and atmosphere. The service is actually really good too.... But after two disappointing trips I needed to write a more or less negative review.  The only problem we have is that for the past two Monday&#39;s in a row, they haven&#39;t been open past 9 o&#39;clock. On Yelp it says they&#39;re open till 11PM and happy hour doesn&#39;t start till 9PM. So twice now we&#39;ve driven there to find out they were closed for cleaning or some sort of meeting.  I&#39;m hoping this isn&#39;t a reoccurring thing because we do honestly like this place and want to continue to go.  
                  This review is for the drink bar.  Everyone is super friendly and helpful. It was my first time here and I wanted to try one f their drinks in the happy hour menu for $5. I ended up ordering the blush which was absolutely delicious. The atmosphere was nice; it was pretty quiet since it was before 6pm. But because it was pretty empty around 5pm, it was really easy to order my drink without having to wait at all.  
                  Upscale bar / sushi lounge near downtown SJ  When we first walked by, we weren&#39;t sure if we wanted to go in--the place looks upscale, with waitresses dressed in formal clothing, high seats, oysters, and really, really small plates. The fact that this place was located inside a food court area did not help clarify if we should go in or not.  Fortunately, we happened to be walking by when the SF Giants were playing the World Series--not being able to find free seats anywhere else in the food court, we decided to bite the bullet and sit down in the bar area. I was happy I made that decision! The food is a bit on the expensive side, with small portions and a high price tag, but worth the price. The service was ok--a couple of times the waitstaff completely forgot orders etc., but in general the food quality is good. And of course, the atmosphere is very comfortable.  Overall, I think I had a decent time hanging out there, but probably won&#39;t be going back since it&#39;s not worth the price.  
                  One of my go-to places for Happy Hour for sure which my review will be based on. Their HH times are 3-6pm Mon-Fri, 9pm-close Sun-Wed.  For $5 each we got their Rose Roll (spicy tuna, crab, avocado), Hamachi Spoons, and Fish Tacos (salmon, tuna, crab). For their $1 oyster special you have to order a minimum of 6 so we got 6 which was perfect since my sister and I were sharing a variety of dishes.  In the end the bill cost us around $22 for 4 orders which made our wallets quite happy. For 2 girls, I thought that was the perfect amount of food so definitely recommend coming here for early dinner if you want to save some money while enjoying yummy appetizers.  
                  I&#39;m never impressed by this place...  Their sushi is ok, their drinks are just ok and they don&#39;t have a huge selection of cocktails (mostly brightly colored blended drinks). I know some people really like their lychee martini but I don&#39;t like lychee.   Will I go back? Probably because people like to go there as a group after work for happy hour.  Will I go out of my way to come her? No.  
                  This place is down the street from our clinic so it makes for an excellent happy hour spot!  I love their $5 taco plate and the sushi specials! What a great deal! I cant speak for the alcoholic drinks but my coworker said they are good!   Love! Love! Love the patio! You can also grab a seat outside and enjoy live music on Fridays 7-9!  You can park in the SJ lots and validate your parking at treatbot if you are going for lunch otherwise  parking is free after 6pm.   I have not come across anything I didn&#39;t like here in regards to food. The staff however can be a hit or miss.    I think they also have a 9-12am happy hour!  
                  This place is just my favorite. I feel like they ways take care of me no matter what.  There food and staff are always great.   Some of my favorite food items: Sushi tacos (1 of each) Hamachi Spoons (they can make them gluten free if you ask) Steak tacos   Overall a great place to hangout with friends or have dinner.  
                  I came here for happy hours with a group of friends. It took us a while to find this place as we didn&#39;t realize it was inside a market. Upon our arrival, it took the workers a while before even realizing we were waiting to be seated. I think in the end, the manager or boss sat us down and gave us our menus. We ordered the fondue, a rose roll, and our drinks. I fondue and the roll was actually pretty good to our surprise. It was pretty worth for the price of $5 each. The drinks were quite appealing as each of them looked beautiful. The taste was pretty good as well. Well...at least for my drink. I had the BYOB with dragon berry run &amp; guava. It was actually not that bad. The other drinks we ordered however, was not up to par. The vanilla sky was basically liquor. It&#39;s good if you went for the alcohol but we ordered a mix drink in order to avoid the heavy alcohol taste. The blush was pretty good as well. As for the tropical Isle, I wasn&#39;t a big fan of it. The waitress didn&#39;t even take note of us, or it felt like it was like that. As every time we were looking around for them to order or to get the check, it just seemed as if we weren&#39;t there. They just kept walking back and forth. Eventually we had enough and went up to ask for the check and ended up giving it to the guy who sat us. I assume he is the manager or boss as the workers listens to him and he was on his laptop. He then took care of us. The appetizers were great, the drinks could go both ways depending on what you order if what you like, and the service wasn&#39;t that great.  
                  Happy hour! $1 oysters are a must! Minimum is 6! No max that I know of...   I also really enjoy their sushi tacos, their rose roll, and a bunch of their food. Their happy hour menu is filled with good food! I highly recommend trying this place out! The environment is lively, filled with music and people passing by. It&#39;s a great place being in San Pedro Square.  
                  I love coming here for happy hour and having a 1 or 2 blushies. Oh man, those give me such a good buzz! Last time, I almost fell off my own chair. Their hamachi spoons, oysters, sushi rolls, and mini tacos are my favorite to order. Sake bombs here are only $3 and the best I&#39;ve ever had.  
                  They have outside seating with heat lamps and they allow dogs as long as they&#39;re not disturbing others. TV outside on the wall too. They have a happy hour menu.  A favorite are their hamachi spoons. Their rib eye sliders were made with chewy meat and not that flavorful, but overall I&#39;ll still give them 4 stars.  At night the girls working seem to have a dress code that you must dress sexy. And I haven&#39;t seen any girls that serve who don&#39;t fit a size 2-4 so they must only hire good looking fit girls. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s necessarily bad but just something I noticed in case you have a guy with wandering eyes then beware!  
                  THE BEST HAPPY HOUR! Definitely come here for happy hour-1$ oysters and cheap drank!  So I have to say, the sushi rolls are pretty small but they are CRAZY GOOD. So incredibly flavorful. Definitely the best sushi hands down. I&#39;m a huge spicy tuna fanatic and it&#39;s literally the best here. The fish tastes fresh but it&#39;s so well seasoned and full of that spicy tuna flavor that it&#39;s incredible.   The rest of the food is pretty good for bites and appetizers to share around. It sucks that you can&#39;t take your drinks out of the blush area like the other bars in San Pedro&#39;s. The lounge area inside and outside are decent and a cool place to meet up before you go out or just chill and grab a drink.  Drinks are really unique and so good! Again happy hour is key!  
                  Came here for lunch with a friend and I was happily surprised with how great this place was.   I had the hummus and the steak taco appetizers (wasn&#39;t really in a fish mood)   Both were super and the prices were reasonable. I would totally go back for more! We were there at a pretty slow hour but all of the service was awesome!! I look forward to going back for more of those tacos. bomb dot com.  
                  First time and I am impressed.  My girlfriends and I have been planning to come here for months.  Great atmosphere all around.  Love the selection choices in the area if you can&#39;t get a seat at this location.  Many options.    We came on a Friday afternoon for happy hour.  Great happy food.  No happy drink, just the happy hour house wine we were told.  $1 oyster!  Perfect size. Very fresh. I love the Hamachi as well.  The rose roll taste like California roll.    Live entertainment outside.  I saw few pets around.  Was happy to see that since I would love to bring my four-legged dog one day.  
                  What can I say, its a good place to go for happy hour with friends. Haha my friend told me about this place when I came back to SJ for the weekend and I went there with a couple of friends who had all came back from school. It&#39;s located in San Pedro Square and its a little area that has both tables and a nice lounge area. We came for their happy hour around 4pm and we ordered a couple of build-your-own Blush, a Blush Isle, Blush, and a Vanilla Sky. The drinks were a beautiful color which made them quite appealing. Its a good place to get mixed drinks if you make a good combo one and it is not strong in alcohol, so if you are looking for light drinks this is a good place for it. We also ordered a couple of appetizer like the Cheese Fondue ($5) and the Rose Roll ($5). The Fondue and the roll was actually pretty good to our surprise, but i especially like the cheese fondue.  Service was lacking because we had to wait for a while for them to notice us and to seat us. After seating us, the workers did not check up on us and when we needed something we would try to get their attention but it was hard because they were always walking back and forth doing something even though it was empty. Finally I got tired of waiting so I went up to the waitress to order more things and then did it again to get the check and pay for it.  
                  I came here on a Monday night at 6:30 with a friend. We got a table right away. There are a few screens showing football which is great!  Food Ribeye sliders - 4 stars - this was nice sliced ribeye. Very well cooked and tender. Brad was crispy on the outside soft on the inside. I really enjoyed this dish. Mac &amp; cheese with bacon and blue cheese - 1 stars - had a very strong Cajun flavor and was way too cheesy! Was not what I was expecting and I would not order this again. French fries - 4 stars - crispy and good Smoke salmon crostini -  3 stars - ok but needed something more.  Salmon tasted good.  Bread could have been crisper.   Lychee passion - 4 stars - we ordered with no alcohol in it was very good. You could totally taste lychee.  We were only charge half price for these which was nice :-) Note - we ordered mostly off their football menu that we actually thought was a happy hour menu. It is not happy hour pricing :-) they do seem to have good happy hour pricing from 3 to 6 mon-fri and from 6 to 9 on Mon-Wed. $5 on some apps and drinks!  Service Our server was Kendra.  Service was adequate. Kendra was very nice.   Atmosphere There are two different parts of about 10 seats apiece that&#39;s probably about another 10 high table tops. The rest of the seating is outside.  I like the indoor/outdoor feel!  Noise Noise level is loud. Not a place to come with family for a quiet dinner :-) more a place to go hang out with friends.  Although  I am only giving this place three stars it is more like 3.5. I will definitely come here again to try more food maybe it can pop up to the four.  
                  LOL i&#39;ll just bump it up another star since the last time i reviewed because i always always have good time and great service when i come here.  im pretty sure ive tried all the happy hour menu (and then some) waaay too many times. but still good every single time. they have a mini cheese fondue that has the cutest setup!  they give you a good amount of bread, cheese and a few cut strawberries. they use a small candle to keep the cheese warm!  also of course, the oysters and their sushi! i always get the rose roll because i know i&#39;ll be drinking too many of those dangerously good blush drinks........  love the bartenders here! they&#39;re really sweet and always great service! ask for Gino, hes the best! The lychee passion is a must have as well as melon mamba! I usually try to ask them to make one up for me and each time is different and stilllllll pretty good. the nightlife here is a hit or miss depending on the days and who goes. on the weekend, most people bar hop around san pedro square  ambience is awesome. slightly modern-y upscale with their black and white decor color scheme. although there isnt too much seating inside, they have cute outdoor seating with heat lamps and such. they also share an outside with the san pedro market and next door to old wagon.  
                  Note: Review is solely based on the HH menu.  Really 2.5/5 stars, but I bumped it up since this place is dog friendly if you sit in the heated patio area.  During HH, we ordered: 1) Oysters: 2/5 eh, not the freshest oysters, and they were bigger than I preferred 2) Blush slushy: 3.5/5 pretty good  3) Hamachi spoon: 2.5/5  4) Seared Ahi Tuna taco: 2.5/5 (for some reason, I didn&#39;t feel like their seafood selection was fresh...It tasted okay, but not super fresh--same with the oysters) 5) Rose roll: 3/5   Nevertheless, great company :)  
                  I love their happy hour! Their coconut blush is my go to blush cus it&#39;s sweet and reminds me of a piña colada. I always pick the same items. Oysters, tuna/salmon tacos, hamachi spoons, tofu martini, and Cali rolls. Other than their HH, their food isn&#39;t worth it. It&#39;s nothing crazy special. I used to be obsessed with their tofu martini but it&#39;s becoming more sauce and less tofu. Womp. Their oysters are $1 during HH but they aren&#39;t the freshest. Their hamachi spoons are definitely one of my favorites, next to the tuna/salmon tacos. I&#39;ll always come for their HH but there are definitely better spots around the bay to grab dinner (and oysters).  
                  I always find myself coming back to Blush Raw Bar Lounge solely because of their happy hour specials! I absolutely love their sushi tacos and Rose Roll; the quality is superb and I couldn&#39;t complain a bit. However, some people still think it&#39;s expensive during happy hour, so it&#39;s all a matter of perspective. Each sushi taco is composed of a crunchy taco shell that is comprised of either salmon, spicy tuna, or imitation crab  (pretty much the interior of a california roll) with shredded cabbage and sauce for $1.50 each. The sushi tacos come in an order of 3, so it&#39;s about $5.00 per three tacos. The Rose Roll is $5.00 for an ENTIRE roll and it tastes delicious! It&#39;s ironic because I don&#39;t eat raw fish at sushi places, but at Blush, I will devour the sushi roll and sushi tacos happily. Also, I don&#39;t personally eat oysters, but if anyone in your party loves oysters, they have oysters for $1.00 each during happy hour! But I&#39;d look carefully when you&#39;re eating them...last time, we found an alive baby crab in one oyster. Ick. It&#39;s actually in the picture I posted of the sushi tacos...okay sorry, I&#39;ll stop grossing everybody out now. Regardless, unfortunate things do happen and you will find a fly in your soup one day or a crab in your oyster. You see it, you take it out, you move on.  The setting is very cozy at Blush. You can either sit at the tables with high chairs or dine at the comfy booths if you have a bigger party. It&#39;s a nice place to take your girls because you can BYOB (Build Your Own Blush) and these drinks look gorgeous! Unfortunately, I remember ordering a drink during happy hour once and it was much too strong for my friends and I so we literally only took a sip on it. If you&#39;re like me and enjoy food more than the drinks at happy hour, definitely try out the sushi tacos!  
                  I&#39;ve been wanting to check out this place for awhile. It&#39;s located inside of San Pedro Square. If you park across in the garage, you can get your parking validated at Treatbot.  Definitely come during HH! The prices are reasonable. I was satisfied with the food we ordered: oysters ($1/each, 6 minimum), sushi tacos and the rose roll. Certain drinks are $5 and you have to try the one named after the restaurant (tastes like juice).  We were quickly seated at 9 pm on a Wednesday. Service was attentive and you will be seeing more of me here!  
                  Expensive for where its located. I thought it was in its separate entity but its in a food court in downtown san jose san pedro square. The service we had was very good and don&#39;t get me wrong but the food was delish. Maybe ill try the happy hour next time. Salmon tacos are on point! Crispy and fresh and I can probably eat a dozen. The cheese fondue was really good for a sushi place. Fun dish to eat with friends. The baked cheese oysters I would pass on. They were cold and small. The cheese was hard and not hot. Drinks were pretty and good and strong. Also I got some roll that had BACON in it its defin a must try! Probably the best roll I ever had! Forgot the name though.  
                  I LOVE THIS PLACE! The only reason why I couldn&#39;t give it 5 stars is because I sort of feel it&#39;s too pricey. Other reviews say they&#39;re cheap, but I guess that just means I&#39;m broke! Lol!  What I Do Love About This Place:  1) Hamachi Spoons: Yellow Tail, Avocado, Jalapeño &amp; Ponzu Sauce. Their yellow tail taste so fresh and so good and the Ponzu Sauce I want to put on everything!  2) Fondue: Brie, Blue &amp; Gouda Cheese with pieces of bread to dip it in. I HAVE TO ORDER THIS EVERY TIME I&#39;M HERE! I LOVE CHEESE! The portion they give for the fondue is perfect size!  3) Blush Drink - AMAZING! This drink makes me want to be an alcoholic!   4) Their outdoor seating is perfect! Cushioned outdoor chairs that are great for groups! If you sit out here you can people watch and some times watch the live bands that play in the middle of the market!  5) The people that work here are so friendly! I do think that they need to hire more staff though for busy times like happy hour.  
                  I came here during happy hour with my coworkers on a weekday.  It was pretty crowded, but they were still able to seat my party of 10 immediately.    I got a Blush [I think that&#39;s what it was called].  It was their version of a Cosmo.  I definitely recommend getting it during happy hour, because it was only $5 and it was soooo delicious!  I think beers are around $3.  I loved the ambiance of this place and the workers were super nice and helpful.    However, someone in our group ordered sushi, and it just looked gross.  The sushi looked really unappetizing and didn&#39;t look fresh at all.  I would definitely come back again for the drinks again during HH.  
                  Great happy hour prices! Hamachi shooters and the cheese dip is the way to go for sure.  Best items on the menu, however have tried a few.  Service is always very attentive. Nice spot and good atmosphere.  
                  Happy hour review.   Their happy hr drinks,  super relish.  I got the blush n it wasn&#39;t too sweet which was perfecto, just super tasty. Tropical isle hubby got it n he liked it.  Foodwise, endamame,  need salt. Rose roll good.  Sushi tacos good but very small.  Fondue came with mainly bread n a few slices of strawberry that don&#39;t belong with the cheese they gave us.  Cheese was not melty but more like lukewarm clumpy,  not so good.  Bread was dry.  Caprese came with mozzarella balls, cherry tomatoes,  skewered in balsamic vinegar...nothing u can&#39;t put together at home. Dozen oysters, OK but when u slurp it, bits of shells gets in ur mouth...not well shucked oysters. Ambience cool because it felt relaxing...maybe cuz I came early afternoon on a weekday.   Service was good.  Wish they had French fries cuz I love French fries when I drink.  It beats any munchies to me. Overall rainy day, cold n cozy relaxing day, just made my day more oh so cozy.  
                  Awesome place.  Oysters bonanza.   The reason why not 5 star was the girl bartender tried to deny me.  And the manager nip it or her in the butt.   I run into this a lot.  Women are intimidated by me and especially taking back at dive bars.  
                  Came here on a Friday night &amp; it was super packed. I had never known they had a HH, but now I know and will definitely be back. $1 oysters?! Can&#39;t beat that. I got the rose roll, cali roll, sushi tacos (mmm) &amp; oysters. Needless to say, the food was amazing. A little pricey for the amount, but the taste is delicious.  
                  Came here last night, getting a drink at 1130pm was a challenge. Elbowing and squeezing my way to the bar was a workout. They have chill cozy seats. The waitresses are cute and adorable. Drinks are reasonable, their blush are a must drink!  
                  3.8 stars for their happy hour!   Happy hour starts from 9-11pm sun-wed  Their kitchen closes around 10.. So that&#39;s disappointing. However, their drinks are pretty good! I got the blush (their signature drink), a dozen oysters ($1 each), rose roll (it&#39;s alright: just a California roll with tuna on top) $5, and sushi tacos (I love these!) $5   I sat outside on the patio and it was really nice! Great place for friends to catch up and if you&#39;re trying to drink more there are plenty of bars in the area.   I would not come here if they did not have happy hour. Food and drinks are good for the happy hour price only!  
                  From the food aspect, this was good. We went for happy hour and the dishes were done well. Not spectacular, but okay. I had the tacos, the sashimi spoons, and raw oysters. There are much better places for raw oysters. The spoons were good. Small, and actually quite expensive for a happy hour dish. The tacos were so-so. Not really exciting or too tasty. Just okay.   From the environment aspect, it was WAY too noisy. Too much echoing. Music turned up too loudly. There is barely any opportunity to hold conversation, let alone speak to your waitress to order food. This would be done much better.  Overall, not bad, not great.  
                  I love Blush bc i&#39;m always in San Pedro in Downtown San Jose when i stopped smoking hahah I replaced it with drinking(I know I know its bad) but anyways, I&#39;m a big fan of the beer market bc im somewhat a fan of IPA(just recently got into it bc of my boyfriend) but anyways, I love Blush during a mid day like... i think their happy hour is 5-6 if im not mistaken and I love their signature Blush swirl its a very girly drink and my girls and i use to go here before heading down to the rest of DTSJ on a weekend! the vibe is awesome ad they have nice workers! I love it bc during the night time they blast music and have the patio open also the only thing i would say is the somewhat downfall to this place is their service when you&#39;re actually there to eat haha. its tough i know but its a job.  
                  I love this place! I love it so much I went 4 times in one week while visiting a friend in San Jose. Best happy hour and drink selection. Not stingy with the pours. You can&#39;t go wrong with any drink on the menu. They need new soy sauce dishes, a lot were chipped, but for the price I can&#39;t complain. Sushi, dessert, drink, and edamame came out to 20 something dollars during happy hour. The rose roll is AMAZING! ! I find myself googling the ingredients and trying to duplicate it at other sushi spots, but it&#39;s never the same. The manager was very sweet as well. Can&#39;t wait to find another excuse to Visit San Jose so I can return to Blush.  
                  This place is really cute for a girls afternoon-out, or well, that&#39;s what my girls and I did on a friday afternoon to catch their happy hour from 3-6pm. They have a limited selection of drinks and appetizers for $5 (that are normally $10) so check it out if you haven&#39;t been here before! Definitely worth a try.  The location is a bit weird; it&#39;s in the corner of a warehouse looking place along with other little areas to eat in San Pedro square and has its own vibe to it.  I ordered a blush cocktail and my girls ordered the vanilla sky &amp; BYOB (build your own blush; the directions are in the menu where you can customize the vodka &amp; fruit slush) and the appetizers we shared were the oysters ($1 each; can only order in sixes) and hamachi spoons (comes in four for $5). We all ordered our own little dish; I ordered the rose roll ($5; has spicy tuna) that came with 6-8 small pieces in a cute little circle for presentation. All in all, the food was good for what we paid for. It isn&#39;t AMAZING or super top quality, but it did the job of keeping the stomach happy with alcohol. I don&#39;t think I would come here for dinner or anytime after happy hour just because the portions are small and not really worth the standard price, but as for our experience here it was enough. 3 stars for food and service deserves another.  
                  I had my birthday party here a couple weeks ago; worked with Chris and Daniel, they were both so helpful and took care of every detail. They stuck to my budget even if my number of guests continued to grow; without compromising a single detail. I invited over 40 guest and Daniel&#39;s staff that night took care of all of us and they still took care of their usual Saturday Night crowd (which is a lot, cause their bar is always packed). I cannot say enough of how helpful, friendly and how great their drinks and food were...will definitely host another event here! Can&#39;t wait till next time! Thank you Chris and Daniel for making my birthday memorable!  
                  Came here on a busy Friday night and were able to grab a corner both seating area quick! We were greeted by a sweet waitress who guided us through the menu and gave us some ideas on what to order. We got, baked oysters- AMAZING! Sushi Tacos-Amazing Sushi Filet Roll-Amazing Pear Salad- Amazing==== Everything was amazing! LOL priced reasonable as well! Def will come back here ;)  
                  Happy hours are AMAAAZZZINNGGG. 1 dollar oysters (6 minimum), 5 dollar drinks, and 4-5 dollar appetizers. Sounds like an great meal for what you&#39;re paying right? We couldn&#39;t have been more wrong. For almost each dish we ordered, there was something wrong with it.   1. Hamachi spoons: There was nothing wrong with how it tasted but we had ordered it twice. We ordered one at the beginning of the meal and one at the end of our meal. The difference in portion size confused us a bit. I almost didn&#39;t even realize I had jalapenos in the first 2 spoons during the first round because they were so small. There was only one visible sliver of jalapeno in the last one . On our second round after the chef changed, the hamachi, avocado and jalapeno portions filled the entire spoon and more. It was terrific!    2. Oysters: Fresh and came in a variation of sizes (mainly small but what do you expect for a dollar?) I was sitting in front of the bar so I was watching the server pick up something from a waste/scraps bin, and without washing his hands, rearranged our oysters and picked up a Tabasco sauce to place it onto our dish. We immediately took out the Tabasco sauce with a napkin and hoped that no extra germs could have contaminated the oysters from the trash bin.   3. Sushi tacos: These are actually pretty good! The seared tuna was the best! We loved the sauce. It&#39;s a little small but it&#39;s worth it for happy hour! They forgot to put in this order so we didn&#39;t get it until we reminded them. Turns out, they something else in but that was never delivered to us.   4. DRINKS! We got the Blush and tropical Isle. The blush was much sweeter/fruitier than the tropical isle. It was refreshing and a great way to wash down the appetizers.   5. Tofu Martini: 4 firm salty tofu cubes! The taste was good but I had to take sips of my drinks because it got too salty.   6. Rose Roll: Aside from the 2nd order of hamachi spoons, this was our second favorite! This one is definitely worth it!  The last thing I&#39;d like to comment on was the service. While it was quick, the waiter who came to take our order seemed like he didn&#39;t want to. He had no pen or paper to write down anything and it would have been okay if he didn&#39;t forget half of everything we told him. It would have been okay if he just gave us a smile instead of giving us an incredulous look when we asked our questions. We weren&#39;t sure if the sushi tacos came with all 3 tacos or if it was one because that was our first time so we asked him but he just said &#34;yeah?&#34; like we were supposed to know and that was a stupid question. When we finished ordering, he didn&#39;t read anything back to us and left by saying &#34;ok.&#34; A waitress eventually came by to ask us what our order was and read a list to us that was half wrong. I assume this was what the waiter remembered from our conversation. We told her the correct order but then I think they still didn&#39;t know if that was the correct order because a few minutes later, the chef behind the counter asked &#34;How many oysters did you order? 6 right?&#34; so we answered and he spoke to the waiter and said &#34;yeah it was 6&#34;. I just felt like if the first waiter just did it right the first time instead of looking down leaned against the chair and nodding, we wouldn&#39;t have this problem. At the end our check was still wrong and said it still had the other items on there instead of what we ordered. It was such a mess. Not sure if I&#39;ll be back again unless I&#39;m really craving some mediocre service.  
                  All around fun place! My boyfriend and I went for happy hour and they have good prices for all the items offered for happy hour. The drinks also aren&#39;t priced ridiculous (like a few places downtown) and the blushy (sp?) was also good and you can make your own and choose your own flavors.   Food wise: everything was really good. We tried a lot because my boyfriend is a foodie.  Lava roll was by far the best.  Spider roll was super good. We also got: Cheese fondu Spinach dip Sushi tacos  Salmon nigiri  Everything tasted really great  We sat at the counter top where the chefs were creating all the food, it was incredible to watch! And they were all really friendly and would talk to us, it made for a fun night. Our server Kendra was also very nice she was just very busy and didn&#39;t really have time to do anything. All around really nice staff and a good experience, we will definitely be back!  
                  Visited Blush with my friends for dinner and drinks on a Thursday night. We got seated quickly, but then again it wasn&#39;t Happy Hour. The ambiance at Blush is hipster: there&#39;s outdoor seating, live music, twinkling lights on trees, and a bunch of dudes with thick rimmed glasses. We were all excited for the drinks, which looked yummy on Yelp. I ordered the Lychee vodka one because it looked all cute, pink and girly. Let me tell you...that there was more vodka than Lychee in my drink (which should be a plus for some of you out there!) I was hoping for a tastier, less vodka-y drink. I felt like I needed chase to finish my drink. Overall, it was an okay drink, more alcoholic than expected. The rest of my party ordered the Blush drink, which was less alcoholic and pretty tasty (the waiter mentioned it was their most popular drink.)   I also ordered their $12 Dragon Roll Sushi. My dragon must&#39;ve been premature cause it was the smallest sushi roll I&#39;ve ever eaten in my life! It tasted average, nothing superb or particularly special.   So is Blush awesome? It&#39;s just alright.  Will I go back? Maybe, possibly, to sit around with my hipster friends under the twinkling lights.  
                  Cool little spot. The food was okay.. Really a good spot to people watch. The drinks were perfect.  Will come back soon.  We had the ousters, sushi ( was okay), hummus.. my favorite was the sushi tacos.  
                  Great place to come for happy hour!! You can&#39;t get a better deal considering how the oysters are a dollar!! The happy hour menu has a variety of discounted food and discounted drinks. The blush cocktail I had was delicious!! The food portions were small but still delicious. In addition to the menu, the atmosphere was very nice with the outdoor seating on point! Also another perk is that parking can be validated at blush since it is a part of the San Pedro Square Market.  
                  Hamachi spoons are good and the outdoor seating is kind of cool.  Service is slow and if you go anytime other than happy hour it IS NOT worth it, incredibly pricey for generic food.  The surrounding area, San Pedro Square is cool.  
                  5 stars for their HAPPY HOUR prices! And it extends to a late night happy hour! Yay!   The items on the HH menu are a good sample of what blush has to offer. I especially love that you can mix your own drink with different ingredients so it&#39;s solely your own creation.   It&#39;s a good mix of fresh oysters, sushi, and drinks if that&#39;s what you&#39;re feelin that day. Plus it&#39;s in the mix of San Pedro square so the location is on point! Definitely check this place out for it&#39;s happy hour if you can.  
                  Loving their Chesapeake Oysters! I can never get enough of oysters for the life of me... This was our first time here and we loved it. Heard it turns into a night club at night..
