                  Somehow I really liked this place.  I had been to the original Bellano Coffee and was so indifferent, I couldn&#39;t muster a yelp review. Something about this was different.  In the corner of this giant space, part of an unexpected food hall in downtown san jose, it kind of seemed like a bunch of friends got together and put together a little coffee-brewin&#39; clubhouse. But somehow it&#39;s good. The coffee is carefully brewed a cup at a time using Hario pour-over cones. The people I went with said the decaf lattes were good.  Here&#39;s my favorite part: the coffee beans. I saw they were selling beans by a roaster I&#39;d never heard of called &#34;Kick Back Coffee.&#34; The design on the bag looked a little like the logo of a garage band some college buddies put together. The barista told me it&#39;s the shop&#39;s  sister roasting company. I bought a bag of the Guatemala beans which had been roasted the previous day. To my surprise, it exceeded all expectations. This coffee hit a sweet spot - very tastefully roasted. Don&#39;t be fooled by the disarming packaging - when I brew these beans at home, there is actually a sophisticated flavor profile that rivals many of the established big names in Bay Area specialty coffee. These beans were light-medium roasted with some chocolate and fruit-like sparkle without being sour.  I find myself looking forward each morning to brewing myself a cup of the stuff.  
                  I&#39;m writing this review as I&#39;m standing around waiting for my iced latte... it&#39;s been nearly 10 mins since I put in my order. I&#39;m giving this a 3 stars based on the entire experience from accessibility to this place and to the taste of their coffee.  First off, good luck with street parking because spaces are limited and there&#39;s a lot of construction going on nearby. I was lucky to find a spot right next to the entrance of San Pedro square after circling around, but I got into a little feud with a lady who claims she&#39;s been waiting on that street for a spot to open up. She went on for 5 minutes claiming how the parking spot should be hers, blocking the traffic. Enough about that story but just beware you would have to pay for parking anywhere around here - this is downtown San Jose - and other people desperately looking for parking may be downright rude. The parking meter only takes coins, which sucks if you don&#39;t have any.  After I got in, there was only 1 person ahead of me ordering. The baristas working there were nice but... slow, and seem to be disorganized. Like I mentioned above, I had already waited around for my iced decaf latte for 10 minutes after paying. I also noticed several people that came in after me get their coffee. I asked twice on the progress of my coffee and then finally I got it after 15 minutes.  The coffee tastes decent, although I can&#39;t really say how good it really is since I got a latte which was 99% clover milk (i saw them pouring it in my cup) and 1% coffee.  My original intention was to come here and do some work... the coffee shop itself does not provide WiFi, you&#39;d have to use San Pedro square unsecured connection which didn&#39;t really work well for me anyway. I ended up using my own cellphone hotspot. Very sad.  I also didn&#39;t see an outlet to charge my laptop.. so given this and the lack of coins for my parking meter, I had to leave in 40 minutes after sitting down (mind you I also waited 15 mins for my coffee).  While the interior is really trendy (I saw some people taking professional photography in here) and coffee may taste good, I&#39;m not sure if I will be back based on the entire experience from my trip to B2.  
                  Was in the San Jose area this morning and decided to try this little gem. I was very pleased with B2 coffee. There was a great vibe in the place. It&#39;s a little hipster-ish but really friendly staff and environment. The menu was very straight forward and there was a small selection of pastries to choose from. I was slightly disappointed that they couldn&#39;t heat up the pastry but it was still yummy anyways!  I got the chocolate croissant and the vanilla latte. The latte was pretty good, but not outstanding.  There was plenty of seating inside and outside. I&#39;m assuming there&#39;s free wifi because there was a lot of people working on there laptops. There seemed to be plenty of outlets as well! Cant wait to come back  
                  Hands down, one of my favorite coffee shops ever. From the atmosphere to friendly baristas, B2 has a strong place in my heart. There is plenty of seating and a fantastic place to study! There is a little bit of noise though, so if you&#39;re a silent worker, I would not recommend this as the best place to work. Also it is nearly impossible to find an outlet so come with your laptop fully charged if you&#39;re planning to get some work done!   On to the coffee~  Latte: 5/5  My go to and favorite drink! The espresso and milk proportion is just right! A perfect combination of smooth and creamy with strong and bitter, making it the perfect wake me up :) 100% recommend to anyone&#39;s first drink here!  Cold brew: 5/5  I cannot espresso my love for their cold brew. Not only is it refreshing, but strong and delicious! Highly recommend to anyone who just wants to chill (hehe) and enjoy iced coffee!   Overall, my visit to B2 has never been disappointing and definitely recommend it too all coffee and café lovers^^  
                  I love this coffee shop, located in San Pedro Square Market. The staff is friendly, there&#39;s plenty of seating, and the coffee is delicious.   The coffee is done as a pour over, and comes out excellent. They even leave room for cream while serving the extra coffee that was left on the side in a separate shot glass.  The drinks are always consistent and well done, and the milk-based drinks are served beautifully.  Hands down, a must-go for Downtown San Jose coffee drinkers!  
                  Quiet AM study area with wide open spaces and a few choice locations with plug-in outlets. Bathroom in the same garage like atmosphere with long tables and stools for the ultimate cool kid vibe.   Coffee is light roast and looks weak at first sight but it&#39;s deviously caffeinated! Extras poured into shot glasses for you to take to your bench to study away. Street Parking is free on Sundays unless you want to do parking validation for the garage next door. Lunch time area in San Pedro Square picks up around noon so quiet becomes busy quick.   Good service, friendly baristas and cashiers with a sweet SF feel. Good place to be!  
                  Super convenient location and very popular during meal times.  They have a very standard that pretty much has a great range of choices. My friend and I both ordered the vanilla latte (which most hipster coffee joints don&#39;t have). Very cute latte art :) Vanilla flavor wasn&#39;t very strong, almost tasting like a regular latte with whole milk. Service was a fast with four or five baristas behind the counter. That was nice since many places will only have two actually working.  
                  I had a super yummy vanilla latte from here. I love the wide open seating area. Perfect to chill out and be creative. There is meter parking outside.  Only downside, I forget what day it was, but there was a kids program happening in the vicinity. Totally amazing and wonderful but it disrupted my work flow.  Definitely come here :)  
                  First things first. Their baristas are super handsome and pretty! They&#39;re talkative and I&#39;m talkative so we all mesh well together, yay! I was going to work here but I don&#39;t have time next Fall lol.  If I didn&#39;t have a strong dislike for parallel parking/driving downtown or if I wasn&#39;t currently living life on the edge, this would be my sanctuary for coffee shops. THE BEST PLACE TO STUDY AND DRINK LATTES! There is just soooooo much space to spread your wings (aka papers, books, laptops, tablets, stuff). Then again, it&#39;s located in San Pedro Square so it does get busy at certain times of the day like lunch, game days, weekends.   All the drinks I&#39;ve tried are top notch, but I can&#39;t say every single drink on the menu are the most amazing, only the ones I&#39;ve tried so far. I&#39;ll give them the benefit of the doubt though. My favorite is the iced chai latte and mocha!   But like I said before, I have a grudge with driving downtown. It gives me anxiety and panic attacks just thinking of people coming out of no where...and small narrow streets, aiyah.  
                  Kick ass coffee. Beautiful location. Nice patio. They serve sparkling water with the espresso just like in Italy.   On a quiet day the traffic outside isn&#39;t bad either. Sit in the shade and enjoy. More seating might be nice but I didn&#39;t have an issue finding a seat on the day I showed up.  
                  B2 has, without a doubt, the best cold brew I&#39;ve ever had. I always come here for a cup. Even my mother, who never drinks any coffee loves their chai latte.  
                  Good coffee makes me happy. This isn&#39;t my favorite coffee place but it&#39;s solid. I feel at this place I&#39;m paying for their good espresso machine and real steam made foam, real cups, and ambience. I&#39;m totally OK with this, which is why I found them after all. The coffee quality itself seems to be lacking a bit as the coffee we ordered didn&#39;t have any character. This could be because we ordered decaf.   We ordered a decaf mocha and a decaf latte. They were served in large ceramic cups.   If you&#39;re comparing the 2 Bellanos, I prefer the Santa Clara one because their pastry selection is larger/better and free, nearby parking. However, there are more places to sit and hang out in the Downtown SJ location. If you&#39;re going to meet up with friends, I&#39;d choose the SJ location because I&#39;d be sure we could find a seat even if we might end up having to pay (a lot) for parking.   I&#39;m not sure when/if I&#39;ll be back because it is kind of a slog to get to this location if you can&#39;t find parking. There was $5-8 paid parking nearby. Luckily today we were able to find street parking. I&#39;d save this location for meeting up with friends. If I&#39;m by myself I want a place that&#39;s easier to access for free so I can spend my money on the coffee.  
                  An artisan coffee shop with an ambience that is very inviting and communal. They serve coffee roasted from the verve made in Santa Cruz. The menu is very small and simple, you won&#39;t be getting a matcha green tea latte here but you can count on whatever you order being great.  Their croissants are pretty great too.  
                  B2 is your best option for &#34;hipster&#34; coffee in downtown San Jose. Sadly that&#39;s not saying much since San Jose isn&#39;t known for a plethora of good coffee and culinary options.  The atmosphere upon stepping inside is pretty cool. It&#39;s part of San Pedro Square Market which is a conglomerate of food stands and shops in a warehouse-like building with very high ceilings and and an artsy-industrial feel. The coffee bar sits crowded up on one side of the building with spacious booths and seating taking up most of the floorspace.   Baristas aren&#39;t the friendliest but don&#39;t openly attack you either (definitely a plus!). They craft some decent lattes and coffees rather quickly.  Once your double almond milk mocha with an honest attempt at foam art is served up you can grab yourself a seat, open up your MacBook and dawn your Beats headphones and just people watch. That&#39;s really the strong suit of B2; the diversity of people that come in is pretty cool.  
                  They are almost getting it. Nothing but good things to say. I just thought the macchiato was to much on the acidic side. Needed more balance.  
                  Excellent coffee. Verve is a favorite of mine (: stop by for a jolt &amp; sit by the garage doors for natural lighting. Sometimes they open it up, you&#39;ll be in for a treat of sun$ fresh air.   Unfortunately they don&#39;t validate, but the other restaurants inside do (with proof of purchase). But don&#39;t let that stop you because their coffee is no force to reckon with.   I got the almond milk macchiato with Verve espresso. Fruity, strong, great pick-me-up after a morning run.  
                  I have been here twice and I certainly like this place. They serve high quality coffee. The entire place is spacial and a little bit hipster, which makes me even more enjoyable with my vanilla latte. Their latte is not too sweet! I like to sweeten my coffee just a little bit; B2 really does a great balance with sugar. Highly recommended if you are a coffee lover like me!  
                  I love that B2 is in the San Pedro Square Market! I&#39;m a huge fan of Bellano, the parent shop located on Stevens Creek in Santa Clara, so I was excited to try this one.  I came by after lunch with some friends, and we just hung out at one of the couches with our coffees on a chilly day. I really enjoyed the ambience and the openness of the seating area; it makes for a good place to sit and chat for a while. The coffee was creamy and smooth, nothing short of what I was expecting based on my experience at Bellano. Plus, the baristas were super friendly!  
                  This place has premium coffee. I love it.  It gets the job done.  The only reason why it is not a 5 star is because they are a little slow but that is only because they make each and every coffee carefully.  Definitely would recommend!  
                  B2 is a branch of Bellano Coffee and they use Verve coffee beans. They&#39;re located inside San Pedro square and serve premium coffee.  Mochas here are always excellent. The hot ones are not too hot, perfectly creamy with very smooth espresso and fantastic latte art.  Iced Mochas here are decent too. Again, not too sweet and perfectly made.  $4.75 for a Mocha.  
                  When I first started visiting B2, they brewed with beans from area roasters like Verve and Sightglass. They now roast their own brand of beans called Knack at an off-site facility in SJ not yet open to the public. The coffee is good, tons of seating in the marketplace, but the brew can take a loooooooooooooooooooong time from order to consumption. Still, the espressos I&#39;ve had have been above average and they take the time with the latte art too. Solid third wave coffee spot in the area.  
                  For being a hipster cafe I thought they&#39;d have better coffee. But it was pretty typical of something you can get at Starbucks.   I&#39;ll stick to Philz or Intelligentsia.   Tons of tables and space to sit and study.  Very few electrical outlets, I could only find 2 near a sitting area, and 1 outlet with no place to sit. Come early to snag one or wait for someone to leave.  
                  best damn latte. talk about satisfying! I stopped drinking coffee when I was pregnant (just happened to crave water and always felt dehydrated) now that I&#39;m nursing I limit my caffeine but still drink occasionally. beautiful latte art In a large round cup... my mouth waters. that first uninterrupted sip of perfection is just absolutely indulgent!    thanks b2! I&#39;ve now made this my go to place to meet up w friends when I&#39;m back in the area visiting.  the space to enjoy your coffee (and food from San Pedro square courtyard) offers convenience and nice friendly vibe.   there&#39;s no big sign but it&#39;s right across the parking structure next to uni uni in the corner. ps no validation for parking but you don&#39;t come here for free parking you come here to enjoy that awesome coffee!  
                  They roast their own coffee beans now and they are satisfactory in both filtered and &#34;espresso+milk&#34; beverages. For Pour-over, I&#39;ve tried several origins and so far sooo good. For &#34;espresso+milk&#34; drinks, I&#39;ve tried macchiato, latte and cappuccinos. Again, they are sooo good. I do prefer cappuccino though. For me it has the right ratio of espresso and milk.   Beware though, their Kouign Amman is more bread like rather than croissant like. I like mine a little bit puffed with lotsa layers.  Overall, I&#39;ll frequent this lil coffee shop.  
                  My experiences at B2 have been OK. I realize that it&#39;s basically a little stand inside the garage portion of San Pedro Square Market, but the times that I&#39;ve been there haven&#39;t been super remarkable in either a positive or negative way.   The last time I had the chance to visit was on the day of the Screenprint Showdown, weekend before last. My husband and I had just gotten a late lunch on the other side of the building and were making our way out to the street when he decided he wanted a coffee. The line wasn&#39;t gigantically long but it was a decent size, though it went by fast (for the time being). As soon as we were next in line to order, the gentleman behind the register said he would be right with us and proceeded to make coffees and wash dishes. I appreciated the communication every now and then, but it was about a good 10 minutes until he got back to the register, as a new, long line formed behind us all the while. There were maybe about 5 other guys making coffee at this time so I wasn&#39;t sure why the only employee taking orders had to be pulled away for such an extended period, but I did hear that they were out of espresso mugs for &#34;to stay&#34; orders, so maybe that was the draw. You may think I&#39;m a judgmental rhymes-with-twitch for even bringing up the wait, but I actually really didn&#39;t mind it all that much... and if I didn&#39;t bring it up then I wouldn&#39;t have much of a review of my personal experience, would I?  A plus to all of this, though, was that I got to pass the time doing something I truly enjoy - eavesdropping on other people&#39;s phone conversations as they stand behind me in line and speak loud enough for entire establishments to hear. She was speaking to her dad and told him she was bummed that B2 was out of their &#34;sweets&#34; - and in turn, so was I. I really felt for her on that one and I hope she was able to find a reasonable facsimile elsewhere for her and her pops.  
                  Mmmm so goood so hipster. (why do hipsters like coffee? are they more tired than non-hipsters? does coffee hydrate them more than dehydrate them?)  This place is nestled on the edge of San Pedro Market and has delish cold brew!  
                  I don&#39;t know how my review could possibly say anything new about this place. I come here as often as I can &#39;cuz it&#39;s one of the 10 best coffee places I&#39;ve ever tried. EVA. All the little details just do it for me: from the perfectly rounded, smooth porcelain cups to the way the baristas lightly tap them on their saucers to even out the surface of the foam to the slight chocolatey hint of the coffee itself. Dare I say it? Palpitation inducing and orgasmic, every time. :) My only gripe: no parking validation here (no longer)  PS: To me, asking for a decaf beverage in a respectable coffee house is tantamount to insulting that business and the baristas and therefore - like asking for a hard, open hand slap across the face. Starbucks is right next block and their schedule is more accommodating!  
                  B2 coffee is a hidden little coffee joint in the back of San Pedro Square.  I would have never been if I wasn&#39;t volunteering at the Jazz Festival, but here we are.  They are exactly what you&#39;d expect from a &#34;craft&#34; coffee shop -- high quality coffee, friendly service, and a dollar upcharge for that fancy foam art.  That being said, it wasn&#39;t TOO ridiculous, since you kinda expect to pay a little more at SPS anyway, and the coffee was good enough to merit the cost.  I just like coffee.  Also note that they sell Verve (Santa Cruz) and Sightglass (San Francisco) coffee.  Local roasts ftw!  They also have pastries, but I didn&#39;t have one.  Looked good though.    I&#39;ll be back for sure.    ---  sweet: quick, friendly service.  good coffee. bitter: kinda hidden, can get busy.  
                  Guys. Please dial in the espresso. I love this place but it&#39;s so all over the place with the shots and I had a really disgusting shot two days ago. It&#39;s easy to think no one is gonna notice but they do and it makes them sad inside.  Really heavily over extracted and pulled short possibly in an attempt to preserve a good mouth feel. But it backfired and tasted so bad I couldn&#39;t drink it.  Love you guys and I know you can do better! Take your time, I&#39;m not in a hurry. Giving four stars because I don&#39;t wanna bring you down.  
                  I had two people rave about this place for their great coffee. So I decided to try it. I had a hot mocha. The barista made a cool leaf design for me and it came in a huge mug. Delicious mocha and sobering after we maybe had a few drinks nearby. This place is located in an unassuming corner of San Pedro Sq. and there&#39;s tables and chairs all around it in a huge open space. A perfect place to chill or study. I don&#39;t think there are too many outlets though if you want to bring your laptop. One of my friends who recommended this place said she comes at least once a week. I think I&#39;m a fan of the atmosphere and the coffee.  
                  For the cute little latte art alone, I would come here.  It&#39;s in a great location at San Pedro Square where you have myriad choices on places to eat, drink and mingle.  I met a friend for coffee here and I ordered a soy latte.  I was happily surprised to see my cute little latte art when they served it to me in a mug.  The coffee itself was definitely not on the light side-- it tasted strong, with the soy milk tempering the bitterness of it.    I probably finished my coffee faster than I intended, but it lasted long enough to keep us company for our almost 2 hour long conversation.  Perfect for two friends playing a game of catch up and laughs.  
                  B2 offers up a slightly different &#34;coffee atmosphere&#34; than you might be used to. Not only does it reside in a rather large room, but it also shares that room with a bar. Coffee joints have become the universal location for studying/reading and enjoying quiet time if you ask me. However, now you&#39;ve not only added the noise from the market itself, but also the TVs at the bar, and people cheering for whatever game is on.   I know what you&#39;re thinking. &#34;Why go there, you know it&#39;s going to be loud&#34;. And I did know that going in. I wasn&#39;t expecting it to be quiet. I merely wanted to check it out and see what it&#39;s like. For the most part it was quiet. But as the evening went on more market-goers showed up. Sharks fans began to show as there was coincidentally a game that night. And that large room began to fill with people, and yes noise. At this point I made my escape, lol.  I acknowledge the different coffee atmosphere there and I wouldn&#39;t mind visiting again. But my preference is still toward the quiet and small shops. The vanilla latte was delicious, and the barista super friendly!  
                  Came here on Labor Day when Starbucks was closed for an iced chai tea latte.   The Latte was great and there is a huge communal work room that a ton of people were sitting in and enjoying their various public market goods.   Reminded me of the hipster places in SF!  
                  Love the atmosphere within San Pedro Market and love that there&#39;s some decent coffee (aka: hipster coffee) within this space. The fact that B2 serves Verve and Sightglass coffee is great.   I have ventured here once and ordered a soy latte, which was just ok. I&#39;m sure their pour-overs are wonderful and this will be next on my list to try.  There&#39;s free wifi here, inside and outside, which is a plus. The tables, high bar seating, booths and outside seating offers something for everyone and makes for a great place to get a little work done.  Overall, great place, decent coffee, just ok specialty drinks.  
                  For a weary traveler it&#39;s worth the 2 mike detour off 101 for a great Gibraltar. Although the milk is too hot which creates the slightly burnt espresso taste, they have excellent tasting espresso which is the essence of the Gibraltar/Cortado  
                  A combo of #ThirstyThursday and the hot-as-balls heat had me running inside SPSM for an ICED (!) Latte at B2, and I&#39;m glad I did. I went the simple Latte route, but I really wanted to go the Vanilla route. Oh well.   Yo they make their own Almond Milk too! Def gonna have to check that out next time. Wish I would&#39;ve tried it this time. So many #ragrets. Don&#39;t fell sorry for me tho cuz I did really enjoy my Latte. The space itself is pretty awesome, right there in the Garage-y area, and they serve the good stuff like Verve and Sightglass.   Highly recommended.  
                  Take the time out of your coffee day to this spot for a few minutes and taste really good fresh roasted bean. They make it on order from basically scratch. This is a top notch stop for a coffee drop.  
                  I really enjoy B2! The workers there are always friendly and great vibes. They also have great options of different coffees and teas!   When I&#39;m in a tea mood I usually get jasmine green tea and for coffee I would get a latte. I episode recommend getting vanilla latte (super sweet, unless you prefer it).   Overall, great coffee/tea, and great friendly workers!  
                  November. Ugh. The month where I have to hear all my super positive friends announce what they&#39;re thankful for and why they&#39;re so &#39;blessed&#39;  every.damn.day .   I&#39;m an ungrateful jerk so I don&#39;t participate but I&#39;ll make a one time exception here and say that I&#39;m thankful to have been blessed with the confidence of a person who&#39;s much better looking than I actually am and for B2 coffee because now that I&#39;m 30 I can handle a hangover about as well as Ray Charles could drive a car.   B2 Coffee has become critical in saving my weekends since apparently 3 beers over the course of 6 hours will put me out of commission for an entire week. Suuuucks.   But you know what doesn&#39;t suck?  Their cold brew coffee.  So good.  So good that while I still prefer my coffee to be at least 50% creamer, I&#39;m totally open to consuming B2&#39;s cold brew sans additives... which is a super rarity for a creamer-loving cat like me.   It&#39;s miracle juice.  It saves you from hangover hell, it&#39;ll definitely keep you regular and the only way it could be better is if San Pedro Square would slap a drive-thru onto the side of the building so I wouldn&#39;t have to walk of shame my way through the market when the second to last thing my head wants is to see humans and the last thing my head wants is to see humans seeing me... or other vendors that sell alcohol. Looking at you, bloody Mary bar.  
                  To be honest, South Bay&#39;s coffee scene is lacking. Besides Chromatic Coffee and Philz, there really isn&#39;t much going on... at least in comparison to Los Angeles, where I was spoiled with a seemingly unlimited number of coffee shop options.  This is where B2 Coffee comes in.  The company I work for recently started to implement &#34;work from home Fridays,&#34; but I&#39;ve really just been working from B2. B2 is my home now, I guess.  ANYWAY, B2&#39;s coffee is great. They serve both Sightglass and Verve, which are two of my favorite NorCal roasters. You can&#39;t go wrong with their almond milk latte (iced or hot). The baristas are fun to talk to and just as awesome as the coffee they prepare and serve. Plus, they have some mad pouring skills.  B2 is located in San Pedro Square Market. There is a lot of space and a lot of seating, but outlets are a little hard to come by, so make sure your laptop is fully charged before heading over.  Oh, and if you live west of downtown San Jose, visit Bellano Coffee in Santa Clara! Bellano and B2 have the same owner, with the latter shop having opened more recently. (Hence the name, &#34;B2.&#34;)  Enjoy!  
                  It&#39;s so hard to find a new coffee spot to love and B2 has come pretty close to it. High quality coffee and a great atmosphere to go along with it.   I like to enjoy my afternoons at coffee shops and study or read and I love how there&#39;s SO MUCH SPACE. I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m suffocating or having to hide myself behind my laptop so people don&#39;t see what I&#39;m doing. I feel free as a butterfly in the space here (lol). The only downside is the limited amount of outlets. COME WITH YOUR LAPTOP CHARGED if you&#39;re planning on studying here.   The coffee was great. I want to come back to try more of the menu. I&#39;m usually picky with my coffee but it was brewed perfectly. I love the feeling of the whole place and the area that it&#39;s in. San Pedro square is the cutest little spot. However, parking sucks.  The only thing that keeps me away from going here all the time. Paying downtown parking is ridiculous.  
                  It&#39;s hard to do things with my one year old around, so San Pedro Square Market is  where I escape to get some work done. As much as I would like to have a glass of wine while I work, it&#39;s probably not a good idea when I&#39;m grading papers or doing report cards. I&#39;m glad B2 Coffee opens early at 7AM where I can get something hot to drink and an almond croissant to help me focus. I heard they serve high quality coffee but I&#39;m not really into coffee, so I don&#39;t really know what a &#34;high quality coffee&#34; is.  Somebody said &#34;the best chai latte ever.&#34; Really?!? The best? So I had to try it. And I liked it very much.  
                  Absolute best coffee in town! Such rich flavor. The homemade almond milk is a must try as well! Nice atmosphere, open air, lots of seating.  
                  I found this on yelp a year ago and have been going back on business ever since when I&#39;m in the Silicon Valley. Worth the drive for a perfect Pour-Over of African beans. And they have delicious pastries too. Slow and worth it.  
                  Great spot in San Pedro Square.  Elliot and all the baristas there know what they are talking about and if you do not know what to get, this is the place to ask for recommendations.  I love coffee and used to come here a lot when they had Sightglass and Verve.  Now they roast their own beans, which is the final step in becoming a solo coffeehouse and their San Martin pour over is full of flavor.  Great for studying or catching up with some old friends.  
                  I always grab a cup here every time I am in San Pedro square.  From Latte to drip coffee b2 has consistency in their coffee.    Good thing is Bellano is near my work, their also baked their pastry daily which is a plus!  
                  B2 is the second location of the original Bellano in Santa, Clara. Although these two are essentially both Bellano, they are completely different from each other. Totally different vibes and feels, but both have great coffee. B2 is part of San Pedro Square so it&#39;s definitely more hectic, crowded, and difficult to find parking. They serve Verve and Sight Glass and their cold brew is awesome. They offer the coffee and tea basics, nothing out of the ordinary, just plain, simple, good stuff. They also have a small selection of pastries. This place has tons of seating inside and a handful outside as well. Great for groups to meet up! Unfortunately although there are lots of seats, they do not have the most outlets, so this is a questionable study place. I only come here with a fully charged laptop or books to read to be prepared if I don&#39;t get to snag one of the seats with an outlet. Much shoutouts to the man in the yellow shirt who was working here when a homeless man tried to kiss me when I was sitting outside this morning. Workers and security on point which matters to me cause feeling safe wherever you go is always important. San Pedro Square isn&#39;t particularly sketchy or anything but I mean, downtown san jose will be downtown san jose.  
                  My go-to coffee shop. San Pedro is grossly expensive, but this shop does a good job of keeping prices fair. My favorite reason to come here, apart from the delicious pour overs, is the repurposed fire house they are located in.  
                  I was expecting to get a cup of Verve or Sightglass here but they did not have coffee from those roasters today. Instead, I got a cup of Knack&#39;s Villa Rosario pour over. The barista clearly put all the care and love into a good cup of pour over. The coffee itself was great; it was toasty, nutty and slightly fruity all at once with good body. It was extracted just right too.  What really made the experience was the barista. I sat by the coffee bar and just happened to ask the barista what the gram ratio of coffee grounds to water was. He was nice enough to tell me and then explain their brewing process in terms of time, weight, and extraction. He asked me what I do at home, the equipment I use and even gave me a few tips. I really appreciated that he was willing to share his knowledge of coffee with another person passionate about coffee.   I&#39;ll definitely come back to B2 whenever I&#39;m in San Pedro Square, both for the coffee and the service!  
                  B2 loses one star for limited outlets &amp; non-validated parking, but the atmosphere, baristas, and, of course, the coffee drinks are wonderful.  As others have noted, B2 is one of the few coffee houses in San Jose that offers the non-dairy option of almond milk, which I greatly appreciate.  Overall, the baristas are really skilled, the lattes are tasty, and, if you can find an open outlet, B2 is a great place to sip your favorite caffeinated beverage while working, studying, or playing on your laptop, tablet, or phone.  
                  So happy to have found this while staying in San Jose for the weekend.  They serve verve and sightglass coffee and have delicious pastries.  I loved my cappuccino and almost croissant!  Great service, atmosphere and coffee!  
                  This was always my getaway place when I didn&#39;t feel like being at home. The coffee is always rich, the staff is nice, and their seating is pretty cute. It&#39;s never really crowded whenever I go so it can be pretty quiet. I usually read a book here or studied, but it&#39;s also a great place for friends to just chill and talk.  
                  Pros: tasty, bitter, rich coffee.  Cons: finding outlets for your technology  ABORT MISSION during peak hours!  
                  Without a doubt, the best coffee in San Jose!  Over the last year, I&#39;ve completely given up dairy, so almond milk is my go to. You wouldn&#39;t believe how challenging it is to find a coffee shop that not only has almond milk, but also makes a decent latte. My search is over! Not only is the location close to my house, but the staff is always friendly and knowledgable, the coffee is always fresh tasting and pulled properly so it&#39;s not bitter, and the best part: THEY MAKE THEIR OWN ALMOND MILK! It&#39;s so delicious, that I often order one, drink it, and order another before I leave.   People watching on point, as well. Great spot.  
                  B2 has become my go-to coffee spot in San Jose! (Sorry Chromatic, I still love you but B2 is just so much more convenient for me.)  They&#39;re located inside San Pedro Square so it&#39;s communal seating inside and out. I usually order a latte or cappuccino, or a chai latte with almond milk if I&#39;m not feeling coffee. If almond milk is your thing, I highly recommend trying it. Their almond milk is delicious with coffee/tea! Pricier than most other places, but they do make it in-house.   The baristas are all usually nice and helpful. Sometimes their system gets slow when you try to use credit card to pay, so I might recommend cash to make things easier. One time, my card wouldn&#39;t go through at all so they told me to just pay the next time I came back. Super sweet of them!  
                  Such a beautiful space. Huge and open and so welcoming. The music is really great too which is always a big plus. I got a latte and the barista who made it (Patrick) was so cool and fun. Love this place and the aesthetic is really rad!  
                  They pull a great espresso, which is rare enough to warrant five stars on its own. In addition, he people at the register are friendly, which is even more rare at the kind of place that makes good espresso.  
                  If you love a good cup of coffee or latte, come here. If you enjoy crap like Starbucks, do not come here. Just kidding, come here but just a forewarning, there are not Crapicinnos aka blended yuckiness.   The employees are awesome. I had been there only two times and the employee, Brittney remembered my name. Although it was probably relatively easy given my name (haha), I thought it was awesome that she knew who I was.   I get a vanilla latte because I am not man enough to get a real cup of coffee but I love it!! They offer almond milk which is a plus. They also make each latte look absolutely gorgeous with a nice little squiggly thing (i&#39;m sure there is a better name for it).    Another plus... The atmosphere is awesome!   The only bad thing is there are no outlets to charge your laptop, so make sure you come with a full battery! Thats not B2&#39;s fault though, its San Pedro Square Market&#39;s. So aaaaaahem (cough, cough) San Pedro, more outlets please!  
                  &#34;On a Wednesday, in a cafe...&#34;   I love this place and just wanted to give a shoutout  to the kind and super chill staff!  I just moved to San Jose and so I wanted to see how downtown was.   Sure downtown Campbell is there but it&#39;s so tiny (same goes for mountain view). University street (or whatever it&#39;s called) in Palo alto is techy and fake but downtown San jose with B2 is on par with San Francisco.   Love it here and it&#39;s atmophere.  Only con :  closes at 7pm.  Fave item : everything  
                  I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way. They don&#39;t have a way to heat pastries and my latte was nothing to write home about.  
                  Venturing into San Jose for coffee, I came across B2 Coffee. Located within a marketplace warehouse building, there is definitely lots of seating to enjoy that morning cup with friends or alongside that sweet, sweet work!  A decent selection of Sightglass and Verve. The barista at the register was repping a GGET hat! Definitely happy to see some SoCal coffee love!  Coffee was good. Great to have a warm cup while the chilly weather freezes everything outside.  
                  Trill staff. Trill coffee.  Coffee made by beautiful baby Angels   Verve, Sight Glass.   I&#39;m on that single origin steeze, yah feel.  Posi. Vibes only. Shout out to my coffee fam., keeping it onehunnit  Ja rule and Jah Bless  
                  Cutest place with delicious lattes!  Interior has a hipster-esque set up with wooden furniture and bright string lights, my kind of place. The baristas were friendly and the latte art was adorable. The vanilla flavor really came through and the foam was perfectly steamed and sweet. Love the condiment bar where you can add more simple syrup if needed, but the lattes are perfect as they are.  Great location as it is right across from the parking garage next to other cute local spots. Would definitely stop by again if in the area.  
                  By far, one of the best places I&#39;ve had for coffee. I&#39;m not really a coffee person but decided to check it out with a friend. Had the iced vanilla latte and it was so good. Not too sweet, not too bitter. Wish I discovered this place earlier because it would make such a great study spot.  
                  A few friends and I made the trip out to San Jose to hang out and get some coffee. We didn&#39;t realize this was located in San Pedro Square Market, but it was a pleasant surprise!  We mentioned it was our first time here and the lady at the counter was sooo helpful and informative of all their drinks and the differences among them.  We ended up with 3 mochas and 1 vanilla latte. Elliot was such a sweetheart and did different latte art on all of ours since we saw the pictures on yelp haha. Thank you Elliot if you&#39;re reading this! You&#39;re great! We all agreed that if this coffee spot was closer to home, it would definitely be our go-to place. So delicious and the top notch customer service sold all of us!  
                  Having been to the original Bellano shop I was excited to try B2, and my visit did not disappoint. Bellano is know for serving some of the best Bay Area roasters like Verve and Sightglass. B2 has partnered with a local roaster called Knack that is located near SJ State. While I&#39;d never heard of Knack I can say they are as good as any of the more well known roasters.   This visit I had the Villa Rosario and the pour over was done to perfection. The cup came out with no bitterness and they extracted the delicate flavors of the light roasted Rosario.  B2 is located in a part of San Pedro Square that is a little separate from the main market. This section has B2 and a bar, but also has a very large open dining area. I came around lunch on a Saturday and the dining area was a great place to relax and read a book. There is also an outdoor area with lounge chairs.  
                  Pretty cool place to hang out lots of space Indoor and outdoor seating, I tried the vanilla latte and wished it just had a bit more vanilla but then I tried the chai latte it was great! I really enjoy it  
                  I have just discovered (10/11/15) that B2 now has their own roasting done under the brand name Knack! So far I have only tasted the cold brew which is typically based on a blend of different roasts, and it is actually quite good. I have to try their pour over to better taste their own creation. On one hand, I am disappointed that they stopped serving Verve and Sightglass roasts; however, I think this is also the necessary and right evolutionary step for any serious coffee place. Just imagine if Chromatic did not splinter off from Barefoot, we would not have Chromatic which is ranked the number one in the Bay Area.  With all that said, the same friendly and knowledgable baristas are still there, and that to me is the main draw. B2 is still the to-go place for your cup of joe around downtown San Jose.  
                  B2 is this casual, hipster-like coffee shop located inside a warehouse. They&#39;re at the corner of San Pedro and St. John Street and can be easy to miss because there&#39;s no distinct sign marking B2 Coffeehouse, other than a small sidewalk chalkboard.   I&#39;ve read good things about their Chai Latte and decided to get it with their homemade almond milk. For almost $5 a cup and having had chai lattes elsewhere, I was incredibly disappointed. The chai latte here tasted incredibly watered down to the point where I questioned if I really did pay 5 bucks for a chai latte or if I wasted my money on a cup of warm water.   I will give B2 another chance when I&#39;m in the mood for coffee, seeing how they brew Verve beans, but for now this place did not live up to its hype.  Street and garaged parking exist. You can get your ticket validated inside the San Pedro Square Marketplace next to the taco stand.  
                  Large open space, plenty of seating, casual atmosphere, hot coco, chai, and coffee were all delicious.  Great place to come to meet with clients before court.  Recommend.  
                  The coffee was good, but didn&#39;t blow my mind any more than coffee I make at home. It is nice to be in the San Pedro Square Market and have a good cup of joe at a reasonable price ($3-4) though.  
                  This is Bellano Coffee...in San Jose! :)  SO impressed. Just as good as its sister coffee shop on Stevens Creek Road. Love love love their creamy almond milk and I must say their espresso machine/ frother is fantastic. I love how the milk fuses together so well with the espresso into a very delicious beverage.  In addition, I like how they have vanilla as a flavor option.  They don&#39;t add too much to overpower the beverage but enough to act as the perfect sweetener.  Kudos!  
                  The best part of waking up ... is B2 in my cup! B2 is where I like to frequent on early mornings to marinate in the ambiance of great coffee and downtown San Jose for hours at a time.   ESPRESSO My pick is a cappuccino, $3.75. Smooth, just enough milk to accompany the espresso but not so much it masks the bean. I tend to drink on the stronger side, but not quite americano strong. One day I&#39;ll try a new drink, but for now, I am extremely partial to my cappuccino. They sell Sightglass and Verve beans here; roasted and delivered fresh weekly. The first time I came through B2 was to pick up some beans only to find they were sold out. Hot stuff! Verve&#39;s Street Level beans are a winner for me. I picked up a bag here before and fell in love with them and am never disappointed with the pulls here.   PASTRY I do not like cream cheese, however I have just eaten a blackberry cream cheese pastry that has so changed my mind, I am compelled to write on it. Today, I was peering into the pastry case and fell in love at first sight (as much as a girl could fall in love with food, I suppose). I love croissants and berries, so I decided to have the pastry to accompany my capp. Best. Cream-cheese-blackberry-croissant-pastry. Ever. Flaky layers, crisp sugar top, tart berry, smooth cream cheese, with the perfect sweetness. I might have to order this every time I come to B2 from now on.  SERVICE Baristas are knowledgeable and amiable. They are hip, but not at all pretentious. The gentleman with the impressive beard has been there almost every time I have, and I think he knows me as the girl who comes for beans. I&#39;m on my way to becoming a regular!   AMBIANCE B2 is my favorite place to study. In the early morning, the music is never on too loud, there is a variety of available seating options, and the area is very spacious. The only minor drawback is the limited number of outlets available: one by the couches that line the windows, and one at the opposite end of the garage. Come early and/or with your gear fully charged and this is no problem at all. A diverse crowd of couples, families, and solo studiers frequent here, as it is accommodating for most anyone/everyone. :)  TL;DR I love B2 for its delicious espresso, friendly baristas, stellar study environment, and overall ambiance.  
                  I love this place! Such a perfect date spot or hangout spot! Large indoor area with plenty of seating. In what looks like a warehouse or garage which adds a ton of charm! A large patio with again a bunch of seating. Cute hanging lights and music playing! The staff was incredibly sweet and helpful. Definitely recommend this place. And so coming back again for sure!  
                  I&#39;m currently pregnant, so I cant try all their delicious drinks but I can tell you they have the best decaf in the city! Actually, I&#39;ll take it one further and say best decaf I&#39;ve ever had- ever. My husband loves their lattes and regular coffee too! Friendly &amp; helpful staff. Pastries are OK- nothing amazing but this is a COFFEE Shop, not a bakery :)   Also, they have the cutest patio to hang out on! Love the entire place. Come check it out- you won&#39;t be disappointed!  
                  Home made vanilla syrup and almond milk. Great, super-friendly vibe. Srsly best cup of coffee I&#39;ve had in a looooong time. Highly recommend!  
                  B2 Coffee is located inside the San Pedro Square. (They&#39;re a branch of Bellano Coffee) Got to try their vanilla latte for the first time and it was a delightful experience. It was smooth and creamy with just the right amount of coffee. Atmosphere is good too since they have a lot of space even if there aren&#39;t many outlets. Overall recommended.  
                  Everything I look for in a coffee shop!   Quality beans, roasted to perfection (I was giddy over their pour over selection)! Well done lattes (with pretty incredible latte art - I had a swan in my latte, no joke, a swan). Not to mention, amazing cold brew! All of the employees are exceptionally talented baristas, friendly, and knowledgeable (and passionate) about their coffee.  The space itself is huge, with a large warm industrial, warehouse feel. Plenty of seating, and beer served on the other side. Everything I could want in a single venue.  
                  Came in on a Sunday morning for a cappuccino. The place B2 is in is such a cool space - love the bar that&#39;s at the other end and the open seating/string lines. Would love to spend an afternoon there hanging out and reading.   The guys behind the counter were super friendly. The cappuccino was decent, but not the best. The milk was too hot and the espresso was bitter, but better than a lot of the competitor&#39;s places. Would love to come back and try their house made almond milk!  
                  Located inside the cozy, hip San Pedro Square Market dining area you can stumble upon the B2 Coffee stand. The coffee here is no-fuss and top-notch quality.   The menu is minimal. Latte art is a given.  A bit pricey, but again - you are definitely paying for the quality here.   The seating here is communal since it&#39;s inside SPSM. Definitely one of the best places for coffee in Downtown San Jose!  
                  Located inside San Pedro Square in the same area as the Garage Bar. This place is similar to Bellano and they serve Verve + Sight Glass here! Yum! Those two are one of my top favorite coffee places. I ordered their cold brew which was on the lighter side and this time left some room for a splash of almond milk and some simple sugar to sweeten it up It was a great refresher to compliment a hot day. The staff was super friendly despite how busy they were and always kept a good vibe going which passed on to their customers. Downfall is parking, but hey park farther and take a walk! Totally worth it!  
                  Came here with a few friends, and we ordered a variety of drinks.  I got a hot mocha, and absolutely loved it. You can tell they use a high-quality chocolate in there, and it melts deliciously in your mouth. Mmm I could use one right now!  One friend got a hot latte with almond milk. I&#39;m allergic to almonds, so I didn&#39;t have any. He seemed to enjoy it though, but said the mocha was better.  The other two both got cold brews. I wasn&#39;t a fan (too sour for me), but they both really liked theirs, so I guess I&#39;m just not enough of a coffee connoisseur.  
                  Great coffee! My wife and I like to come here early on the weekends. Very nice/chill staff. Their cold brew is my favorite, anywhere.  
                  Perfect latte. Great atmosphere. Friendly staff. Good selection.  Yelp thinks this review is too short, but, really, that&#39;s all you need to know ;)  
                  B2 is found in the Public Market, hidden from all the other food places.  You sort of have to wind your way to the back in the corner (at least the way I went).  They serve up a very tasty latte complete with latte art.  I am a sucker for those little pieces of artwork in my coffee cup.    Yes it&#39;s a hipster spot and the coffee drinks will be more expensive, than say Starbucks, but the coffee is delicious and is well worth it.  Lot of seating available.  There&#39;s free wifi but it was a little spotty for me.  I would definitely be back if in the area.  
                  This quaint coffee establishment is part of many great places in San Pedro Square. They use Verve coffee and tailor make each drink your specificity. Their cappuccino was PERFECT. Their almond milk delicious. Their homemade almond pastries are excellent  
                  Possibly downtown&#39;s only good coffee shop. Friendly staff, good coffee, great location, and ample seating. While the San Pedro Market Garage is an awesome location most of the time, occasionally there are events with loud music that ruin the atmosphere, and often the entire garage is closed for a private event. Would be nice if they had a cart or something like that they could park outside on days they have to close for a private event. Maybe hit up the Kartma guys?  
                  Best espresso in San Jose. Finally. This is seriously the only option if you&#39;re down there. Think Blue Bottle, Ritual, Stanza etc, etc...Hurrah for B2! And the San Pedro Market, in-general, is a great spot for eating an socializing.  
                  Until I had a cup of coffee at this place the other day, I wasn&#39;t sure that a coffee shop could even get 5 stars because I was used to Starbucks and every one being exactly the same. This place is very unique and definitely not a Starbucks! I had the &#34;pour over&#34; coffee, wasn&#39;t sure what that was until I saw the barista actually pouring the hot water over the coffee grinds out of a little kettle very slowly and meticulously. That cup of coffee cost me $3.75 which at first seemed pretty high but after I drank it, well it still seemed very high, but it was an awesome cup of coffee... I guess you get what you pay for?     I&#39;ll definitely be back!  
                  Love this place! Our office is on San Pedro Street, so it&#39;s a quick walk over for a great cup of java (Starbucks is downstairs from us but I&#39;ve just about had it with how slow and packed it is there, not to mention their drip coffee isn&#39;t all that great).    They hand pour all the coffee which gives it a fresh, smooth flavor. Today I had an Americano with just a dash of half and half and it was delicious.  I have also had lattes and hot herbal/black tea there as well, and they were also delicious.  The baristas are super friendly and always remember us and our orders, which is a nice touch.  They are located in San Pedro Square Market, so there is ample seating both indoor and outdoor.  Free wifi makes it a great work or study spot, and ideal for casual meetings.  It&#39;s lively without being really loud and overwhelming.  Love you B2!  
                  Amazing! Wow! Why? Besides the friendly and skilled staff, they serve Verve&#39;s coffeee! Definitely one of the best I have ever had!  
                  3.5/5 stars  Very hipster, modern venue--located in San Pedro Square.  Great place for professional meet ups since the setting is very laid back.   Coffee was high quality as well.  
                  This is the first time I come to the coffee shop .I ordered a vanilla latte and it was simply amazing. I like the the atmosphere and the employees were really friendly and knowledgeable about anything related to coffee especially  the girl with the short hair ,the tall white guy with the glasses and the short guy and the Pearson on his nose ,I wish I they were wearing name tags so I can just mentioned their names instead of giving their  description lol . I will definitely go back for the delicious coffee and the friendly attitude of the employees .  
                  Another pleased customer for B2 Coffee! Great beverages and awesome ambiance warrants four stars for B2 Coffee.  One of my favorite things to do is to retreat to a coffee house and sip a nice cup of hot or iced tea while typing away on my laptop or reading. I&#39;m new to the area (and Yelp!) so I thought I would give this place a try. Truly glad I stopped by.  I got an iced peach green tea and it was sweet and super refreshing. I&#39;m kind of snooty when it comes to iced tea, but wherever B2 sources from is bomb! The tea flavor was very pronounced and their ice to tea ratio was spot on. They didn&#39;t add too much much ice to water down the tea flavor, a common mistake among many places.  The environment is great too. It&#39;s spacious and pleasant with abundant natural lighting. I came in around 10 am on a random Thursday and there were plenty of seats available. I&#39;m not sure what the traffic looks like during afternoons or weekend though. Additionally, the shop had a diverse audience: young to old, business people or leisurely chatters, and the quick grab and go type. I wasn&#39;t sensing the synthetic elitism that prevails in some other coffee shops I&#39;ve visited.  Downsides that compelled me to give it only four stars instead of five: the price and lack of outlets. While my iced tea was reasonably priced ($2.50), other items on the menu looked kind of expensive. Perhaps that&#39;s just me not being accustomed to the higher cost of living out in San Jose (again, I&#39;m new around here). Secondly, your computer better have a long battery life because I could not find many wall plugs for my life.   Nonetheless, a solid place!  
                  Flavorful, never disappoints.  They always make my coffee/espresso drinks perfectly and they have a good selection of pastries, both savory and sweet. Coffee is never burnt nor too hot. Nice open area with plenty of seating.
