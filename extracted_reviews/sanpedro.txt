                  It took years for this place to San Jose!  Really cool concept. Adult beverages, tons of variety of food, people...who could ask for more?!  + Spectacular place for big groups.  Everyone can enjoy whatever food they are craving and you do NOT have to worry about splitting a bill.  + Always fun to watch sporting events here.  + Summer outdoor concerts are always a bonus to your dining experience.  + FREE WIFI, although it can be kinda crappy at times.  + Tons of outdoor seating.  + Get parking validated here. 2 hours free parking.  + Always do events here: SJMADE to Whiskey tastings to Latte Art Throwdowns...there is always something going on.   This place is always a default for me.  Visitors in town, take &#39;em here!  
                  I love San Pedro Square!  But do NOT go to the burrito place near the entrance. They do no serve breakfast burritos (even though they say they do) They do not give validation (even though they say they do) Their food is cold.  I was really looking forward to breakfast burritos and the menu claims to have them from 9:00AM-11:30AM.  They didn&#39;t even open until 11:00AM, I order them, they don&#39;t even have anything for breakfast burritos there.  I ended up paying 25$ for two regular burritos that weren&#39;t even heated up, with no validation (even though I asked prior to ordering to make sure and they said yes), and no apology or answers.  I said, &#39;I came here FOR validation. so what am I supposed to do? I just paid 25$, does that mean I have to order something else that $10+ just for validation?&#39;  &#39;I&#39;m not sure.&#39;  &#39;Can I cancel my order?&#39;  &#39;No.&#39;  The person helping me had no remorse, no apologies, just a smile with a &#39;thank you for your money&#39; type of attitude.  Everything else here is great, but this is just a forewarning for this food service place! :/ I was really upset.  
                  San Pedro Square is one of my favorite public places to grab a drink and hang out in the South Bay. The food here is good, and I wouldn&#39;t come out of my way to eat anything, but I come here for the versatility. Here&#39;s a list of things I&#39;ve done here:  Ate Drank Watched Sports Met Friend Met Friends Met New Friends Ran into Old Friends Trivia&#39;d Gotten Tipsy Gotten Drunk Heard the Person I was Talking to Listened to Live Music Played with Dogs First Date&#39;d Pregamed Postgamed Drank New Beers Waited very long to use a Toilet Paid Too Much for Food People Watched  Danced Karaoke&#39;d   San Pedro Square is great. I&#39;m really glad San Jose has it.  
                  Nice airy place to walk around in, although I was somewhat disappointed by the selection of restaurants -- there was vietnamese, mediterranean, mexican, new england, and italian. Many of them didn&#39;t look that appetizing. We decided to go with the wood-fired pizza in the end since it looked the most fresh.   As for drinks, they had one main bar as well as a smaller bar and a coffee bar. We were on the hunt for some root beer on tap, but alas, no luck. The selection of cocktails wasn&#39;t very interesting -- they just expected you to order your own mixed drink from the bar.   Lots of seating and free wi-fi meant that there were quite a few (about eight) laptops open with people working or just surfing the internet on a Friday afternoon. There weren&#39;t any outlets that I could see, but it was still a nice open and airy place to get some work done for a little while.  PRO TIP: Many of the stalls in the market will validate two hours of parking at the lot with some minimum purchase.  
                  San Pedro Square Market is kind of like an indoor restaurant collective (food court) with tons of fresh, delicious options and a beautiful dining atmosphere outside.   Should you try it? Yes  Ambience: Although this is a food court atmosphere, it&#39;s open and breezy. I went on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn&#39;t too crowded. We even got a table to sit at outside in the lovely patio area.   Service: Everyone working seems to enjoy their job.   Location: Excellent! It&#39;s a pinnacle of downtown San Jose, as the streets beside the market have become what&#39;s known as San Pedro Square. Lots of great, top notch dining available around, awesome hi-rises popping up within blocks of this place.   3 Key Tips: 1) Try Pizza Bocca Lupo&#39;s lunch special - 1/2 pizza and 1/2 salad. Awesome fresh ingredient large personal wood-fired pizzas! 2) Sunday afternoon wasn&#39;t too crowded so don&#39;t worry!  3) There are 2 buildings as part of the market that I know of (don&#39;t miss the second building!)   Recommended Dish: Pizza Bocca Lupo&#39;s Tomasso pizza (veggie!)  
                  Pros Great date night spot Plenty of food and drink options inside and around the area  Fun, lively atmosphere  Great outdoor area  Cons Validated parking machine is gone now and requires minimum spent at certain merchants (makes sense but a bummer)  Exiting the garage can be unreliable  Bathroom situation can be a mess   Overall Thoughts Still one my favorite places to hang out while in downtown SJ  
                  This is such a lovely market square! If you are driving south from SF or north toward there, be sure to stop by this downtown marketplace in San Jose. Whether you are hungry for a quick lunch or just want a quick stop, San Pedro Square Market is your place.  Surrounding a historic square with a nicely-restored (or maybe reconstructed) pioneer house are two buildings filled with about a dozen of various food vendors. The most charming aspect about this marketplace for me though is the hipster vibe with everyone is chill. San Pedro is just a really happy place to be! You don&#39;t have to buy anything here to really enjoy this place.   Parking is metered street. Unless you plan to dine here, you should be able to explore its entirety well within an hour. Like I said though, just make a quick stop here and you&#39;ll see why this place is so relaxing!  
                  My favorite place to hang out! A spacious place to sit with so many options of delicious food and drink! There are two sides of the Market with more room to sit in the Public Market area. Food choices range from pasta to pizza, fried seafood to pho and spring rolls, pad thai to burgers, baked potatoes to arepas, and so much more! Grab a drink from the Beer Market and watch a sports game with friends with everyone being able to choose what they&#39;d like to eat! You have got to finish the meal with ice cream from the Treatbot truck! It gets super busy during lunch hours, dinner time, and game nights (Warriors, Sharks, etc.)!  My favorites: Konjoe Burger - Konjoe Burger (BEST BURGER I HAVE EVER TASTED) CaliDog - Srirancha Fries TreatBot Ice Cream - Honey lavender, Pandan Macapuno, Strawberry Basil  
                  3.5 but only because I&#39;m tainted and biased from experiencing the Anaheim Packing House, 4th Street Market in Santa Ana..OC Mart Mix, etc. =x  It&#39;s definitely one of the better places to hangout though without having to go to the city. Good beer, decent food and seating for big groups. The best thing about it is the availability of variety so everyone can just pick what they want and reconvene.  
                  Despite the fact that I have an 80-year-old&#39;s heart, soul, and sensibility, I love coming to San Pedro Square Market. My inner curmudgeon only really makes an appearance when it comes to finding parking (always) or securing a table (sometimes).   I can safely say that as vendors come and go - and stay, as it seems the case has been with quite a few of the spots in business now - I have tried almost everything they have to offer and can&#39;t say much of a bad word about any of them. My current favorite place to get some grub is a tie between Bray Butcher Block &amp; Bistro and Spuds USA... and also Treatbot... but add Pizza Bocca Lupo to the list. Clearly, I can&#39;t decide.   It&#39;s a pretty widely known fact that this is a really fun place to hang out, whether on a date before heading elsewhere or with a larger group of friends, so I really probably don&#39;t have to do much selling here. It&#39;s centrally located and really awesome to continue on down San Pedro to visit any number of the other establishments, so if you&#39;re looking for a good time, just go!  
                  Have I died and gone to heaven? Because my idea of heaven is a huge space with tons of delicious food and free-flowing booze. Wait, there&#39;s two entire buildings worth? Even better!  Seriously, I couldn&#39;t talk 3 feet without seeing yet another food stand I wanted to try. Plus, they validate for the parking lot across the street, so free parking to boot!  
                  Awesome spot in San Jose. Tons of restaurants, and bars! Wasn&#39;t able to see much of an outside due to rain, and weather but it looked like it would only add to the establishment. Can&#39;t wait to go back. Reminded me a lot of Grand Central Market in LA! Add this to your list of what to do in SJ!  
                  San Pedro Square Market has many  food vendors as well as a bar within. haven&#39;t been here before, just visited the food trucks outside years ago.  first reaction is sticker shock. eats/drinks higher here than some places in the bay area. OTOH pricing is similar to new businesses opening in S.J. pricing may be on par with food trucks and similar food venues in s.f.  another negative is the lack of meter free parking nearby (didn&#39;t see many, not that they don&#39;t exist) only saw meters that takes CC but not coins.  footnotes: -night time would have no meter issues, no need to pay after 6. -fab place to eat with friends who have different food urgings. -lots of siting -beer market seem pricey. ($10 for Drake&#39;s Denog?)  
                  Love the atmosphere, vibe and choices of food.  My only issue with the patio area is the pavement.  Could you PLEASE fill in the cracks?  My back heels have gotten caught in them.  No bueno.  
                  Really nice Food Hall.   Not like a mall food court, but a gathering of various foodie options.  There are two separate buildings with a variety of food options.  From fresh seafood, pizza and even an intimate wine bar.  Each building is open (on the inside), there are normally large TVs playing games and groups of people eating, drinking and being merry.  Its loud here. But in a good way.  Casual, and semi-dressed.  Great for a date night, a group gathering or a place to bring the family.  
                  One of my favorite spots in San Jose! It&#39;s a cute, trendy little market area with unique food and decor. It&#39;s probably one of the only reasons I would venture to DTSJ.   One of my favorite happy hour spots - Blush Raw Bar &amp; Lounge - is located in here in addition to a variety of other food stops that have pho, pizza, pad thai, burgers, and more! I would definitely recommend a visit to San Pedro Square if you&#39;ve never been, and you&#39;re in the area looking for a trendy, spacious place to eat/drink with a friend.  
                  Whoaaa...what is this place?  A cross between a small Pike&#39;s Place, The Farmer&#39;s Market located in LA&#39;s The Grove Shopping Area, and a good ole&#39; food court, San Pedro is cool and quite the place to chill.  I&#39;m a Bay Area native, but don&#39;t venture downtown SJ much. Imagine my surprise when I came across this little gem of a place! Okay, it was not cute enough to be referred to as a &#34;little gem.&#34;  The seating is a variety, but much of it is long wooden table-style.  Lots of food options: - Desserts (cookies were dissapointing) and ice cream - Asian cuisine - Potato bar   And More!  So worth a visit! And a return visit. And another. And another. Restaurant and food variety!  
                  When I am indecisive about what to eat I know exactly where to go San Pedro Square Market. This place is perfect for brunch, lunch, dinner, or late night eating.  My go to spot Little Chef Counter is no longer there but there are plenty of options to choose from. Pizza Bocca Lupo, On A Roll, Phonomenal, Treatbot, Market Beer Co, and other great places to eat or drink are all located in the market. There is plenty of validated parking across the street in the parking garage or on surrounding streets. You can either sit inside or outside. Inside has plenty of wooden tables and benches to eat on. If you&#39;re going with a larger group I&#39;d recommend someone saving a couple of tables outside. SPSM usually has live music outside especially on Friday and Saturdays.   If you&#39;re going to lunch with a co-worker, going on a first date, convening a beer club meeting, or just hungry you can&#39;t go wrong with SPSM.  
                  It&#39;s essentially a really trendy food court and I kind of love every bit of it... but especially the potato bar. Yes, you heard that right. A.POTATO.BAR.    I can&#39;t think of any reason not to love SPSM except for maybe when there&#39;s a local sporting event happening... then I find this place sort of absolutely terrifying but only because I couldn&#39;t give two sh*ts about sports and the intermittent screaming and charging at screens by hundreds of people at the same time while I walk of shame my way to B2 Coffee for hangover relief really scares the poop out of me.   But other than that, all I&#39;ve got is love for San Pedro Square Market.  There&#39;s two different buildings with a sort of garage/market/open air mall type vibe and it&#39;s nice because you can come casual, you can come in your PJs, you can come in a suit and you&#39;ll still fit right in here.   There&#39;s plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, a really cool historic pueblo building that I&#39;ve been meaning to learn more about when I go but keep getting side-tracked by aforementioned potato bar, there&#39;s often live music, happy hour specials, free wifi and they did a pretty good with spreading the outlets arounds, it&#39;s a stellar place to meet friends since there&#39;s truly something for everyone in every department- be it food, booze, and/or entertainment, and at the same time it&#39;s still the perfect place to chill out and be a loser like me, errr, I mean loner like me with just your laptop or book or even just people watch.   The only thing it might not be great for is a date, but even that&#39;s not entirely true because if you&#39;re meeting someone from some rand-o internet site (looking at you Craigslist and all the burgeoning Craigslist killers out there), this is prob perfect since it&#39;s always busy, it&#39;ll keep the vibe super casual, and it would be really hard for anyone to murder you without making a total scene of it. Come to think of it, SPSM is the perfect place to make it known to someone that they&#39;re in the friend zone and 100% never getting out of it.   I&#39;d love to come back here to drink and food hop around with friends some time. Kind of like a hobo tapas where everyone orders a little something from each food court stand and then we all feast at once. This would actually be the best place to do an adult orphan Thanksgiving meal for the transplants living in the Bay area without families and without the money or mind to fly back during the holidays.  
                  I&#39;m almost a San Jose Native and I just barely found out about this place, I&#39;m shocked I hadn&#39;t come to this place sooner!! I remember back in my clubbing days Taste Nightclub used to be located here but once they closed I wasn&#39;t worried about what would be taking over the space that is until recently. I heard great things about this market and all of the yummy restaurants so I finally checked it out and boy I was in for a treat. I&#39;ve been here quite a few times and I&#39;m always here for a long time and find it hard to decide what to eat with so many different places to choose from.  San Pedro Square Market is a public market which houses close to 30 different vendors and split between two buildings. This is the &#34;it&#34; place in Downtown SJ for foodies, sports enthusiasts, lovers of great music/entertainment, those in dire need of good happy hour bars and those who just want a cool place to hang out. You can find just about everything here from old school barbershops and local shops and eats to the home of San Jose&#39;s oldest building, the Peralta Adobe. SPSM is full of lively people talking and having a good time while enjoying everything this place has to offer, there is never a dull moment here.  There&#39;s so many different places to choose from, guaranteed everyone will be satisfied. Here are some of the good eats:  *Pizza Bocca Lupo: They are VPN certified and the South Bay&#39;s first Neapolitan pizzeria that is cranking out some awesome pizzas fresh out of a handmade brick oven made in Naples, Italy.  *Loteria Taco Bar: If you&#39;re looking to get your Mexican food fix this is the place, they have everything from tacos, nachos, fresh made churros and even deep fried pickles.  *Konjoe Burger Bar: The perfect place for a good juicy, fresh burger made from premium beef and high quality ingredients.  *Market Beer Company: Not only do they have all the best and different types of beers but they also feature live bands.  Those are just a few of the awesome places here. There&#39;s lots of tables and seating both inside and outside in the patio area but it does fill up quickly and gets pretty crowded especially on game nights. This is and will remain my go to place when I&#39;m in the area and can&#39;t figure out what to eat or just to go for happy hour or a sweet treat!!  
                  Reminds me of Pike Place in Seattle, but the contemporary form of it where there are plenty of bars to go around and restaurants to check out!  It&#39;s spacious and there&#39;s a lot of parking.  One can be here day and throughout the night!  
                  I&#39;m giving it a 3 star but it&#39;s because San Pedro Square is overhyped.  Almost every realtor and many people that live in the area recommend visiting San Pedro Square, it&#39;s really nothing more than a few restaurants in a secretive location.  You go through a door and you will find it&#39;s a hallway with restaurants and bars with plenty of places to sit.  Mexican, Asian, Hotdogs, etc.  The coffee here is recommended and this is a great place to socialize.   Park on the street if you can if you are dropping by.  If you are planning to stay for a while, you can pay the flat fee at the parking structure.  
                  This is a cute place to hang out with friends or family . It is a very hip food court, and it includes food like tacos , burgers , pizza, and Asian fusion. So be sure to come here for an empty stomach!    I came here just for a cup of vanilla latte , and it was really good ! I would definitely recommend. If you don&#39;t know where to go in San Jose downtown, this is a great place for you to chill a bit :)  
                  Everything you&#39;re craving, affordable prices, Golden State Warriors basketball games, trivia nights &amp; more.  You can come here on a lunch break, a date, or a big group. It&#39;s versatile, with indoor and outdoor seating, everything from Mexican food, sushi, bar food, and hotdogs and burgers, and even some lounge like places.   I&#39;ve had: Italian food, vegetable lasagna. Sushi. Potato suds with lots of stuff to put on top. Nachos, French fries with nacho stuff on top, and way more. Fried chicken and waffles!  Overall, there are so many restaurants here, so the ratings vary. They are anywhere between a 2 and 4.5. Nothing here is super, crazy 5 stars good, but most things are decent.  There are lots of choices at varying prices, so come here and watch a game or play trivia night and have some fun with food and friends.  
                  This is a beautiful square full of good eats! Treat bit and the hot dog place was good. Great indoor and out door environment.  
                  Hands down this place is awesome! We came here on a Friday night and the place is packed! During the summer they have a band playing outside and its always so lively. Everyone we bring here enjoys the experience. There are a variety of restaurants to choose from! My favorite is he Cali dog! It&#39;s a pricey 7 dollar hot dog but worth every penny! We usually order a variety of dishes from a couple of the stands because it&#39;s really hard not to try everything! And never once were we disappointed! I also love the sushi tacos from the sushi bar! The service there is nice and the food is good! Parking at the garage is fee as kings as you get your ticket validated and mostly all the restaurants you buy food from will validate your parking!!!! So if your looking for a fun and low key night this place is the spot!  
                  This place is the coolest food court I have ever been to! It&#39;s located in the heart of downtown san jose and is within walking distance to the tech museum. It  is accessible by public transportation as well. There is street parking around the area but the meters only allow a max time of 1 hour so make sure you come back to feed it often! $2/hr when I went on a weekday during lunch.   There is both outdoor and indoor seating and TONS of diverse food options. I should have come hungrier than I did but I shall return and eat to my heart&#39;s content. The food choices range from pasta to gourmet hotdogs and burgers to tacos to falafels to desserts of all sorts, coffee, wine, and lots of beer. This is the perfect hangout spot with friends because it has such a variety of food and drinks that will please everyone. I tried the calidog which reminded me of DOJO dog food truck that I loved so much on the Berkeley campus back in undergrad. It&#39;s a hotdog topped with japanese mayo, tonkatsu sauce, and lots of seaweed and grilled onions. However, the hotdog came out a little small and I wish it was saucier but nevertheless, it was pretty yummy.   A lot of people come here for lunch and it&#39;s such a relaxing and fun place to just hangout! Looking forward to going back =)  
                  San Pedro is a great place to eat and drink before you head to the Sharks game. We all know how expensive venue food could be, so why not start here?!   There are tons of different places to eat from. It&#39;s one giant food court with a bar! Super crowded but I didn&#39;t mind. There&#39;s an outdoor patio with those fire heaters to keep warm around this time of the year.   Definitely cannot wait to come back and try some of the different variety of food they have there.  
                  Great place to sit down to eat some great food.  Theres a pretty good variety of food from pizza, potatoes, asian, bar food, indian etc.  sometimes they have a live band going and the ambience is pretty chill.  There is outside and inside seating!  The only thing they can improve on is getting more seats in the area.  Around 5:00pm this place starts getting super crowded and its hard to find a place to sit.  There is also a pretty nice beer buffet in there of craft beers, and a pasty/sweets spot as well.  All in all a pretty badass food court!  
                  This is is definitely one of my favorite places to go to at night! The night life here is great. There is a lot of food choices that im sure it&#39;s all pretty good and I like how there is an indoor beer bar and the selection is pretty crazy. I mostly just get the peach beer (I forgot the name! Ask for it. It&#39;s really good!)  The outside seating is really cute too! It&#39;s definitely a good place to hang out with your friend and catch up or if you have a date you can come here! Definitely recommend people to go here to hang out to eat and drink and just have a good time.  
                  Centered in the heart of downtown San Jose... This place is a one stop shop to delight in different foods and desserts with your family or friends. You will run into the trendy, the business, families, or College students here. Watch out for crowds during sharks, 49er, or Giants games!   Love the atmosphere and will be spending lots of time here when it gets warmer!  
                  Love this place!  Great place to grab a bite, have a drink and just chill.  Lots of unique food selections.  Good beer and drinks.  Fun and tasty desserts.  Relaxed atmosphere.  Ample seating indoors and out.  Parking lot across the street.  I find myself stopping by here whenever I&#39;m in town.  I always discover a new beer that I haven&#39;t tried as well.  Good spot!  
                  This place is great and packed. However very efficient. And the bathrooms!!! Clean!!! I love all the different types of food. We only hit a food spot toward one of the entrances and i had an amazing grilled fish sandwich which was huge with fries. Unfortunately I forgot to check the name of the dish or storefront. I wish I was starving when I went because I wanted to try all their fish sandwiches. I love seafood. And then came the other food, deserts, then we spotted the bars! We bar hopped pretty much after that. I can&#39;t wait to come again!  
                  San Pedro Square Market is home to some of the best &#34;night-life&#34; style bars, pubs, and restaurants in downtown SJ. Opening wide-eyed at 7am to serve freshly brewed coffee and closing with night caps around 2am...the square is somewhere you should definitely visit when you&#39;re in town.   Each establishment within the square is independently owned and operated. But the restaurant owners it rents to provides a crazy variety of food and drink to satisfy whatever craving you have.   Some of the more popular restaurants in my book are: Blush Raw Bar &amp; Lounge, SP2, Treatbot Ice Cream Truck, and Konjoe Burger. I probably frequent these the most. Either way, you don&#39;t have to be eating to hang. There&#39;s a bar and plenty of indoor/outdoor seating throughout the day! Most of these restaurants provide parking validation for 2 hours in the garage which makes the visit almost impossible to resist (Sharks game nights are exempt from this however).   The garage also offers permit packages for people who are interested in using that parking garage as a regular parking home for your cars.  
                  Very nice place to enjoy outdoors with friends and colleagues. There are limit options for jain food, but they are pretty good. I use to have pizza at Pizza Buca Lupo, ask them to make vegan pizza and tell them about garlic allergy. Their red sauce does not have any onions or garlic. Pizza is good, not filling though if you are really hungry.   Another options is an italian place in front of piza buca lupo. They have Butternut squash ravioli, it does not have any onions or garlic. But its better to confirm by telling them not to put onions or garlic. There is another thai place in another plaza and they can make fried rice and noodles.   So all in all good options to eat while all your friends can enjoy variety of food as well. Everyone goes home happy! :)  
                  We had a wonderful evening with live music, basketball and good food. There were a lot of people and a lot of food choices. I&#39;d definitely come back again.  
                  One of my dinner/lunch go-to&#39;s in the area because there&#39;s something for everyone here and all at pretty reasonable prices. Some of my favorites are Pizza Bocca Lupo, Bray Butcher Block and Bistro, Konjoe Burgers, and Marker Beer Co. I formerly really liked Little Chef Counter too, but they have closed down and turned into some seafood shack place (I don&#39;t think it&#39;s opened yet).  A really chill marketplace to hang out in. There&#39;s plenty of outdoor and indoor seating but it does get crowded so sometimes it is hard to find a table.  
                  &#34;Have you been to SPSM?&#34; seems to be what I often ask my peeps when we get together. I&#39;m always surprised when the answer is no, but I realize most people I know don&#39;t live in downtown San Jose, they&#39;re scared of downtown SJ, or they don&#39;t use Yelp. So I try to be a gracious host and show them this part of my neighborhood. I have not brought anyone here who did not like this place.  Here&#39;s a sample itinerary for a whole day of fun! Make sure you have $$$$ in your pocket!  7:00-8:00AM  Have a cup of coffee and an almond croissant at B2 Coffee. This is a good time to like all the posts and pics on Yelp and Facebook.   8:00-9:00AM Try a savory crepe @ Cre Paris. I&#39;ve only had their dessert crepes so let me know how it is!  9:00-10:00AM Since nothing else is open this would be a good time to get a signature cut or shave at Crewner&#39;s. Be sure to make a reservation!  10:00-11:00AM On A Roll is open! I haven&#39;t been inspired to try anything here but since nothing else is open, now is a perfect time to try their dishes. Good or bad, at least you&#39;ll have something to Yelp about!  11:00AM - NOON  Have a mimosa at the Market Bar. There&#39;s usually sports on TV but watching people at the market is more entertaining.  12:00-1:00PM Get It&#39;s a Burger from Little Chef, then get a burger at Konjoe&#39;s. Compare them side by side. Maybe give somebody a blind taste test. Which is better? Repeat with fries!  1:00-2:00PM Time for dessert! Get the 408 in a waffle cone at Treatbot.   2:00-3:00PM You&#39;re probably stuffed with all those burgers, fries, and ice cream. Take a break from eating and check out the Gift Shop. Now is the time to buy some San Jose post cards you&#39;ve been dying to send to your loved ones. While you&#39;re waiting for happy hour to start, head over to Ay Dios Mio and browse through their Latino stuff.  3:00-4:00PM HAPPY HOUR @ SP2! (Actually, this is not part of the San Pedro Square Market, but it is right next door and it&#39;s not bad.)  5:00-6:00PM HAPPY HOUR @ Blush!  7:00-8:00 PM Try one of the 200 craft beers from the Market Beer Company. Head over to the Garage bar for another drink. Sit down, relax, and enjoy the live band (if there is one)!  8:00-9:00 PM Dinner time!!! Your choices are endless!  1st Course - Hummus &amp; pita bread (make sure it&#39;s warm) from Robee&#39;s 2nd Course - Cod taco from Loteria Taco Bar 3rd Course - Pho #2 with brisket and meatballs from Phonomenal 4th Course - Margherita from Pizza Bocca Lupo 5th Course - Corned Beef Reuben from Bray.  10:00-11:00 PM Before the day ends you must have a warm chocolate chip cookie from Chocatoo. While you devour the cookie, watch people and make up stories about them.  11:00PM-2:00AM Cap off the night with a wine flight and a tiramisu from Vino Vino. Go home, get some sleep. You&#39;re probably going to have to do this again for 100 more of your friends and family!  
                  Hands down one of my favorite places downtown. You will easily find me here multiple times a week, I&#39;ll be the one ordering everything. Evvvverrrryyythinggggg.  There are tons of food options in here, so it&#39;s a great place when you&#39;re with a bunch of people and can&#39;t decide on a particular food. I&#39;m working my way through all of the restaurants here and have only been disappointed once with the food (it was a salad, but who really cares about salads?! JK I do. Sometimes.)  They hosts tons of events throughout the week (trivia night anyone??), they have a calendar online, and I was just here actually for their last summer movie night. Which was tons of fun and crowded, glad I got there early for good seats!  If you&#39;re going out in downtown for game/show/drinking, this would be a great place to grab a quick dinner and meet up with your people. It&#39;s also great on the weekends in the daytime, super chill and I can enjoy my Bloody Mary in the sunshine.  My only Con about this place is how crowded it gets during weekday lunch hour. But what can you expect when there is tons of great food in one area?  
                  We&#39;ve come to San Pedro Square many times before, but this is the first time that we&#39;ve stayed awhile to hang out and have a beer. Sometimes you&#39;ll get lucky and there will be live music playing. It can get insanely busy here and difficult at times to find a place to sit/hang out. There&#39;s a wide variety of places to get grub from however a lot of them are pretty high priced for what you get. Street parking can be a pain but luckily there is a parking garage practically right across the street. While I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to come here every now and then it&#39;s a nice place to try a new brew.  
                  San Pedro square! The best place to eat, to drink, to talk, to have fun with friend or family.   Where ever you go, they are Always friendly!  
                  My wife and I stumbled upon SPSM while visiting downtown San Jose, and I&#39;m glad that we did. I&#39;m sure that we&#39;ll return the next time that we visit SJ.  We both got coffee from B2, which I guess is named after everyone&#39;s favorite BINGO number? Don&#39;t come here if you&#39;re in a hurry because the baristas take their time. The coffee was worth the wait, but we almost had to feed the meter again. Don&#39;t do what we did, though. SPSM validates parking at the garage across the street. Get your proof of purchase card from the vendor that you patronize, then give it and your parking ticket to Treatbot for validation.  Here are some things I&#39;ll want to check out the next time that I&#39;m downtown:  - Pub quiz at The Market Bar, Mondays at 7 pm. - Farmers Market, Fridays 10 am to 2 pm. - Pizza Bocca Lupo. &#39;Nuff said! - SPSM Bar for Happy Hour. M-F, 4 to 6 pm and all day Sunday! - Market Beer Company. Yeah, I think this has to happen.  They do a bike clinic on the last Sunday of the month at 2 pm that unfortunately wouldn&#39;t be practical for me as a visitor, but I highly encourage locals to check it out.  Please ride responsibly!  
                  Great place to come with a large group so that you don&#39;t have to spend hours brainstorming for a place everyone likes (you have many food options to choose from here). You also don&#39;t have to pay $230942034 for gratuity like your group would&#39;ve at a restaurant. It seems like there are random events that happen here (such as live music, trivia, etc). I personally liked the live music outside at dinner time... the sun setting, sky changing colors, lights wrapped around the trees, talented musicians, people having a good time (even dancing some times)... amaaaazing!! Food is decent. I have yet to find a place here that I really, really like... other than treatbot&#39;s ice cream.  
                  This place rocks because of the sheer variety of food options, live music, and overall fun atmosphere.  It&#39;s such a &#34;poppin&#34; place!  You can come here a dozen times and you&#39;ll still not have eaten the same thing!  My only disappointment is that Little Chef&#39;s Counter has gone out of business!  
                  Went to hang out here on a Thursday night and the crowd was decent. Not too crowded and not empty. It&#39;s a casual chill place to hang out. Whether for food or drinks the atmosphere is a picnic in the park. You can also bring your dogs. There&#39;re tons of picnic tables and seemed pretty decent and clean. They had a live band which was great. The music wasn&#39;t loud, therefore its perfect for dates, group dates or catch up with friends.  
                  Brick and mortar type of market that is not such. In San Pedro Square Market you will find a compendium of restaurants and small stores, so many things in my &#39;to try&#39; checklist! I tried La Loteria tacos as well as the gyros from the restaurant across it. The restaurants do share common tables and chairs in the interior and the atmosphere is somehow hipster, something I would not have except i somehow dull San Jose (so far, still getting to love this town). Parking was easy and access to this place was too. I like the outside signage, very neat.  I like that everywhere you can get those flavored waters and the overall prices are low/moderate (didn&#39;t check that nice wine bar, or is a beer place? though). If you are a lost tourist in town or a convention center goer, you can always buy the typical postcard-souvenir (I am still surprised those are for sale, I wonder who sends postcards these days, but hey, business creation!). When I went was during lunch time and it was packed with professionals having their pizza or taco fix. I liked what I saw and would like to experience this place at night, they offer some concerts in certain days, so check those out too!  
                  I&#39;ve been here a couple times now and it&#39;s a cool place to shoot the breeze.  A wide variety of food vendors here to please your appetite.  A handful of bars throughout as well to provide your beverages.  Seating at peak times can be somewhat difficult, so if you have a large party maybe have one person try to find a place while others grab food and drinks.  I came with coworkers for Monday trivia night and seating was more or less being saved by folks for their teams by 6 PM.  Luckily, when we inquired with the staff, there were foldaway tables and chairs that they setup for us so we would have a place to sit.  Definitely come check it out for a casual bite/drink, or come and compete at trivia night!  
                  I wish I knew about this place sooner because it&#39;s for sure now one of my new favorite spots in San Jose! The atmosphere is very laid back yet still upscale. This place has it all!   When it comes to food, think of it like San Jose&#39;s classy version of a food court which includes breakfast burritos, burgers, tacos, BBQ, poutine, desserts, pastries, multiple bars for drinks, basically everything. There&#39;s plenty of seats and tables inside and outside for those who like to enjoy nature. There are even seats located a bit farther away from the main food section for those who just want to study or chill without too many people walking by.   All of the restaurants here are very unique and aren&#39;t they typical franchises you&#39;d see in a mall food court. Rather, the food is all made with premium ingredients and tastes amazing. Also, you get a buzzer when you order food, so you can walk around a grab a beer instead of waiting for them to call your name/number.The prices are a bit higher, but it&#39;s totally worth it! I expect to come back more often to try everything this cute place has to offer. Great place to meet up with old friends and new.  
                  Love San Pedro Square. It&#39;s a great place to meet up with friends or coworkers, or just run and grab a quick bite.   Food: The food is very good and the variety is exceptional. Just to name a few, you can enjoy pizza, salad, crepes, tacos, hot dogs, sushi, ice cream, poutine, etc. Yeah, you heard me right, I said poutine. Delicious.   Price: Gourmet fast food? I think that puts you around $15 for a meal depending on where you go. Obviously depends how hungry you are.   Seating: There is quite a bit of seating inside and outside. Both are good options. They&#39;ve got booths, chairs, big tables, benches, etc.   Awesome spot. Large variety of different food and restaurants. Definitely hit this place up if your group can&#39;t decide what to get and need some options!  
                  San Jose itself is just a bedroom community with a growing business district.  Not much to visit in this city, except for this place.  This area has many shops and restaurant while maintaining the retro image.  I would come back here but only if in San Jose.  Being a big city type of guy, I  consider the market fairly small but great for the city.  
                  Cool spot, lots of places to get food from ...it&#39;s like being at a fancy foodcourt in a mall minus the annoying lighting. Great if the weathers nice &amp; yu can chill on the patio &amp; hear some good music  
                  The hippest of hip --- any place that has craft brews and steaming hot cookies is a-okay in my book!  
                  I didn&#39;t really know what San Pedro Market was, except that it had food.  It reminds me of Anaheim Packing District in SoCal, but not as hipster-y. The market area itself is spacious, and not too crowded.  There&#39;s a couple of food places, some fancy sit-in places, while others sell speciality desserts.  There&#39;s seating inside and outside of the market; I&#39;ve visited during peak lunch hours and there was no trouble finding seating. Overall, a nice environment to get food if you work in downtown San Jose. It&#39;s worth the walk.  
                  I LOVE hanging out at San Pedro!   There&#39;s a good mix of everything here and I love the communal atmosphere. I haven&#39;t tried everything here, but I do enjoy coffee from B2 (sister location to Bellano), ice cream from TreatBot, poutine/duck fat fries from Little Chef Counter, pizza from Pizza Bocca Lupo, and baked potatoes (!) from Spuds.   It&#39;s an easy place to take larger groups as everyone can find food/drinks to suit their own cravings. There&#39;s plenty of seating outside and inside, but it can get crowded sometimes.   Validation for the San Pedro garage (across the street) is provided at the bar. Overall, great place for a chill, casual hangout with friends. There&#39;s something to please everyone here!  
                  This place is divided into 2 buildings and is what I envision for food courts, but very few execute it this well. The food selection is awesome and extensive, the beer selection is way above average, and there are events every week that pull in huge crowds (trivia, live music, etc.). Being the beer head that I am, I personally enjoy the side with the vast bottle selection. It has sliders, Phô, ice cream, and BEER. It is a great place to start the weekend night or if it&#39;s a weekday try to catch to one of the events! The trivia on Mondays is hard but very fun. It was one of the first places I visited when I moved to San Jose a couple years ago and I still visit it today.  
                  Always a fun spot to stop in for a bite to eat, grab a drink, and enjoy the fun atmosphere!  
                  Plenty of food choices. Tacos, pasta, pizza, Greek, Vietnamese... There&#39;s a large patio with heaters and outdoor seating so dogs are welcome :)  
                  Normally I give downtown San Jose a hard time, but this place is pretty neat! Reminds me of the Ferry Building in SF but more affordable, less crowded and with places to sit with your food. If that doesn&#39;t help describe this place, think of it as a stand-alone food court with a slightly higher quality standard. There&#39;s also a parking garage across the street and meters on the surrounding blocks.  I ordered a cold brew from the B2 cafe, and chicken and waffles from the Konji Burger stand - not the best I&#39;ve ever had, but the seasonings were interesting (they also only had compostable knives out, but no forks, and only gave me one when I asked, as if I had asked her to do me a huge favor...).   Our compatriots had a delicious-looking take on a loco moco from Little Chef. We sat by a bar, and over the course of a couple hours had a couple beers as well. My only gripe is the bar doesn&#39;t have a sink for water, so they can only sell you a bottle for $2 or refer you to their main bar in the other building.   My friend went to the main bar and brought back two shot-glass-sized cups of water. So I walked across the room back to the B2 cafe (espresso machine = access to water) and got a normal-sized glass of water without hassle.   I&#39;m not driving down to San Jose on the regular for this market, but if I&#39;m already coming to town to meet friends, this is a great spot.  
                  Awesome spot for great food. The pizza shop is great and I ate entirely too many ice cream sandwiches.   Perfect happy hour spot to meet up a few people.   Boom!  
                  San Pedro Square is one of the newer hot spots in downtown San Jose. (DTSJ if you&#39;re hip) It&#39;s a few blocks from the SAP center so any time there is a major event going on the SPS will be popping. You may want to factor that into your schedule. If anything, plan to arrive after the event starts.   The venue has an indoor area with some outdoor seating. It&#39;s fairly well lit and can accommodate large groups of people. I have been to many mixers/networking events here so it seems to be a popular spot to get together.   They have 3 bar areas and a few places serve beer along with the food. If you want to sample a little bit of everything there are a variety of dining options available as well. I have tried food from most of the establishments and have yet to be disappointed.   My missing star is because sometimes due to the large crowds it can take a while to get your food order. Also, it can get incredibly loud indoors with so many people talking or trying to navigate the walkway.  
                  Got to come here for the first time this week. I haven&#39;t really gotten to experience the full experience since I didn&#39;t get to eat anything here. It is typically hard for me though to find gluten free and dairy free options. I had called a couple of the places ahead of time to see if they could accommodate and they unfortunately did not speak English very clearly so they could not understand what I was asking which kind of sucked.  We ended up just getting a bottle of wine to-go from Vino Vino and walking around the rest of the market. We eventually did find a seat and boy was it just beautiful outside. We are so lucky to be in California and it&#39;s in the 60&#39;s at night time in February. I hear they do live music here during the summer which would be awesome to go too. This seems to be just a hoppin&#39; place and I can&#39;t wait to come back.  
                  It&#39;s such a neat place to explore and dine! Located in San Jose, looks like a warehouse with not much around this area, but it&#39;s deceiving. Inside the concrete walls contains plenty of different and delicious eateries, ranging from beer to poutine fries to ice cream. It looks like a food court because of its centralized location of food and open seating. You order at the counter of the food booths and wait for your number to be called. Once you get your items, you can take it to where you choose to sit. There is indoor and outdoor patio seating. So everyone can find something they like and be able to sit together. There is also dessert and (non-)alcoholic drinks.  Great place for brunch, lunch, dinner solo or with friends, co-workers, family, and whenever you just want to chill. There are tv&#39;s available to watch sports games.   Go check it out! :)  
                  Good food. Average atmosphere! Plenty to chose from! Like the beach shack! Enjoyed sitting outdoors! Relaxing spot!  
                  This is a great spot in San Jose to get a good drink, eat some good food, watch a game , and listen to live music. One of my favorite spots just to hang out with friends.  
                  Community Area with a large variety of vendors, it&#39;s a perfect gathering place! I&#39;ve tried Konjoe, the coffee place called B2, and Treatbot here. San Pedro is pretty large and they have two buildings, it&#39;s great because you can meet with people sit wherever or around their designated area and everyone can just meet and order on their own.  
                  This place is as chill as it can get.   This is a great place is grab some great food, grab a delicious beer, and just kick back and relax with your clique. First off, parking is easy. Park at the parking structure in front San Pedro Square Market. Be sure to validate your parking ticket before you leave. You walk in you can choose to sit inside or out. Some nights there is live entertainment at the outside seating area. Not the best or worse but hey thats what sets a great mood. As you are slowly embracing the environment, feel free to get some food and grab your choice of beer at the Market Beer Co. And there you have it, the plan to a really chill night with your crew. Restrooms are everywhere here and easy to locate.   In conclusion, out of the few times coming here, I&#39;ve always had a good time with friends/family.  
                  Just landed in San Jose and this is the first place I stopped at. This place is so adorable. The ambience is casual and is great for any age. Although their market is probably towards adults since there is a bar, I saw a lot of families enjoying their time here. They have a great selection here. There&#39;s Thai food, burgers, tacos, gyros, ice cream, drinks and desserts. Anything you can think of is all in one place!   Every food stand I went to had great service and it was really easy to find a place to sit. Even though it was a Friday night it wasn&#39;t as crowded as I thought it would be which was nice.   Definitely a stop if you&#39;re ever in San Jose!  
                  Lot&#39;s and lot&#39;s and lot&#39;s of great food options here!  No matter what you&#39;re craving it doesn&#39;t matter cause they&#39;ll have it, no doubt.  Great place to catch up with friends in the area or to grab a quick lunch during the work day.  The Old Spaghetti Factory is pretty original and greatly enjoyed the Pasta Options, Buca Lupo has pretty awesome pizza options with an assortment to choose from... still making my way around the area to try more eateries.   Sometimes on the weekends there&#39;s even live music in the courtyard area.  Can&#39;t remember the name of the band from last Saturday, but it definitely made the experience all the more wonderful.  
                  Can&#39;t believe I haven&#39;t reviewed SPSM yet! What a downtown gem. I work on San Pedro and just moved downtown, so I frequent SPSM quite a bit. From breakfast and lunch, to dinner and cocktails, the place has something for everyone, from sunup to sundown. Here&#39;s a breakdown of my faves:   Eats:   // CreParis for breakfast crepes. Made fresh, they will keep you satisfied all morning. They also do dessert crepes, but I haven&#39;t had one yet.    // Spuds for loaded baked potatoes. The perfect hearty lunch, you can choose from their menu items, or build one to your liking.    // Blush for sushi and/or cocktails. Great ambiance for happy hour, with great music always bumping. Love the indoor/outdoor seating. Menu has some fun twists in addition to sushi, such as Hamachi Spoons and Sushi Tacos.   // Konjoe for amazing burgers (I&#39;ll end there, see review)  // Treatbot for a tasty ice cream treat.   Drinks:   // B2 Coffee for a fresh, delicious pour over. Ample seating makes this place great for meetings, study sessions, or just hanging out people watching.   // Market Bar for drinks while watching the game or just hanging out.  I love the huge mirror so you can spy on people behind you while sitting at the bar.   // Market Beer Co for an amazing selection of craft beers. Knowledgable staff will help you find the perfect beer for your palette.   Bonus:   // Ay Dios Mio has great Latino &#34;arte popular&#34; especially around Dia de los Muertos.   // The live music series &#34;Musicians at the Market&#34; is always fun, especially on warm summer nights.   Wish list:   // A juice/smoothie bar   // A good taqueria (Loteria is just ok)  I hear they are expanding and creating a second location nearby to accommodate the new high rises that are going in, and I can&#39;t wait to see what else we get!  
                  This is a cute place. I came here for the  first time last week. On a Sunday at lunch time, there was a fair number of people, but it was still easy to get around.  It was a bit difficult with the food vendors in two buildings (navigation is difficult with three young kids in tow between two families).  The outdoor seating looked promising with kids, but we ended up eating inside, which was fine. The long tables were useful, and I found the place to be clean.  I find myself preferring the Anaheim Packing District and Oxbrow Market more because the layouts make more sense to me. However, this is a great and easy stop if you are attending an event at the SAP Center since it&#39;s only about a 10 minute walk away.  
                  San Pedro Market has expanded so much since the last time we were here almost 2 years ago. It&#39;s almost a completely different place and was packed with people having a good time out. The food and drink options here were pretty great, so we got to try out more this time around and even came back the next day to meet up with friends.   There was live music, cocktails, a beer shop and food vendors that sell some great fare to share with friends and drinks. We tried out both Bray and Phonominal, which were good and will update more in those business reviews.   If I was a local, I would be here often. It&#39;s a great place to grab food with friends and mix it up. GOOD TIMES!  
                  This place is cool, and especially cool for San Jose.  FOOD - I have tried La Loteria and Pizza Bocca Lupo and both were quite good, with PBL being my fave given that it&#39;s $7.50 for a half salad and half margherita pizza. Yum!  AMBIANCE - Casual yet nice environment with seating outside or inside, and both are lovely options. Good for groups and pairs of two. Just awesome.  P.S. If you park in the garage across the street, you can get 2 hours validated inside.  
                  TREATBOX. Ice cream!  I got Ube, Milk &amp; cookies, and Horchata.   Ube was aight, but I definitely recommend milk and cookies! The chunks in milk and cookies were just soo good. Horchata was also very good as well. I also sampled their Chocolate Sriracha Caramel, to my bf it tasted spicy but all I got was chocolate.   I wish I tried their burger place and the new potato place, but when I do I&#39;ll update this review!   Overall I really enjoy the chill relaxed ambience here and it reminds me of the Anaheim packing district in Southern California but less packed.   Recommend!!  
                  Great nighttime spot in San Jose.  There are a ton of excellent food options, from food stalls to attached restaurants like Vino Vino (thumbs up). There is also a giant beer garden type area that has live music on the weekends. There are of course attached beer, cocktail, and wine bars.  A couple of my favorite places: Vino Vino - Wine-tasting / gastro pub. 4 stars but I don&#39;t know any gastropubs better in the area. Chocatoo - Fantastic desserts. The cookies here are unbelievably dense and chocolatey, my favorite.  I mainly just love the atmosphere. It always has a great energy, and I just enjoy heading over here for dessert or to hang out, even if I&#39;ve just had dinner nearby.  
                  This is a great place for any tourist to come - whether it be with friends or by yourself. I had some time to spare on a Saturday and I decided to venture out to the city. I heard that SPSM was the hub for restaurants, trinkets and speciality shops.  From the convention center, it was about a 15 min walk and whichever way you choose to walk, it&#39;s pretty safe. Actually, for a Saturday, downtown wasn&#39;t busy. There was a lot of people eating, but traffic wasn&#39;t bad.  It was cool to check out the various eatery spots and very convenient since everything  was very accessible. There is a parking garage across the street which is great given it&#39;s super close to the square.   Highly recommend when you&#39;re in town. It&#39;s super lively at night with all the neighboring restaurants and bars popping.  
                  I am in love with this space. It&#39;s everything I want my happy hour, after work drink and light meal with coworkers, or even a start to date night venue to be.   Walking into San Pedro Square and you&#39;re greeted with an array of artisanal dining options and shops. Men, need a straight razor shave? They have a barber shop located under one roof - although the square consists of a couple of buildings surrounding a courtyard. Nonetheless, it&#39;s an awesome place to chill and grab a drink or in our case, all that while watching some FIFA. The indoor/outdoor open air dining is a nice touch. We found plenty of seating.   Parking can be found on private lots, a parking garage across the street or by simply utilizing the VTA  located a couple of blocks eastward.  Note: check out the newest stand serving up arepas, yo!  
                  San Pedro market is the spot to be at downtown. Wether you are trying to get your happy hour on, want to grab a bite to eat with friends, or start you pre game.   The atmosphere is very causal and it is great to meet up with friends for dinner or happy hour. You can all buy your own food, and there are a ton of different options for everyone, best part is you won&#39;t have to worry about splitting our bill or gratuity. There are so many different types of food, everyone;s tummy will go away satisfied from mexican to pizza, sushi or salad, american or asian fusion, San Pedro has it all.   There is both indoor and outdoor seating for large or more intimate groups. I love the courtyard on hot summer nights, the inside is fun to meet new people by the bar and get your drink on, and of course have a good time!   Overall, San Pedro is the best place to start your night in Downtown SJ.  
                  I&#39;ve been here a couple times already and always have a great time. The location is beautiful and the food is great. There&#39;s always love bands playing on Friday and Saturday night so be sure to catch them. The one time I went on Sunday at 8pm, a lot of food places were shutting down, but the dessert and beer bar was still open.  There&#39;s a huge parking garage right on San Pedro that I usually park at. Don&#39;t forget to get validation when you purchase something. Otherwise it&#39;s $5 to exit the garage.  
                  Great atmosphere, easy and relaxing, not to mention the delicious food. Outdoor and indoor experience, sometimes live music.  I love that it is always changing.  
                  Absolutely awesome. Great food, and beer selection with a chill ambience. Check it out!  
                  Growing up in Nevada, I literally had no idea what happened south of San Francisco (or North, for that matter).  I had no idea that &#34;the Bay Area&#34; included such a large geographical region.  I had no idea that approximately 20 &#34;cities&#34; and 55 miles separated Saint Frank and Saint Joe.  My knowledge of San Jose was limited to the following:  I knew that it had a pro hockey team.  I knew that the team&#39;s colors were turquoise and black.   I knew that the team had followers who put the FAN in the word fanatical... but that&#39;s about it.  Mystical San Jose...   I expected to step off the train and be swallowed by screaming Sharks fans who would not hesitate to shank me if I showed any sign of rooting for another team. For this reason and this reason alone, I walked cautiously and with a purpose for a little over ¾ of a mile from the train station to San Pedro Square Market to meet a pal for dinner and drinks.    This absolutely awesome 2-building &#34;marketplace&#34; is filled with small vendors of all types!  There is a sushi bar, a clothing company, a beer store, a taco place, a dessert truck, wine, among othes.  Its laid back vibe makes it the perfect place for anyone and everyone to get together.  It&#39;s like if Off-the-Grid met a Farmer&#39;s Market, and they had a baby.  And then, meanwhile, a food court and a bar met and had a baby.  And by some miracle, those two babies met and copulated... this would be what they birthed...   There was a Sharks game on TV (and there are TVs everywhere), but the sea of turquoise and black was much more docile than I expected.  I did squeak out &#34;GO SHARKS&#34; nervously a few times, just in case I looked suspicious.   Stellar showing for my first trip to SJ!  I still can&#39;t believe that so much is crammed into a relatively small space.  San Pedro Square Market inspired me to find out what else is in store in my 55-mile long back yard!  
                  I LOVE how you have multiple choices for food, bars and a large seating area to enjoy the yummy food.  We really enjoyed our meal from Spuds Potato Bar with mostly organic and local ingredients. Absolutely delicious!!! And the deserts from Chocatoo were divine!!!! Lots of gluten free options as well.  Will definitely go back next time I&#39;m in San Jose.  
                  A great place to spend a Thursday night in my book. Lots of people who are excited to be eating, talking, and drinking.   You might run into a sour apple here and there, but overall a great area to just hang out and choose from all kinds of cool foods to eat. Mmmm....food!   A nice little piece of real estate where fun is in the air and which can turn frown upside down! Worth your time, if you real need to enjoy yourself with a certain type of crowd.  
                  Cool place to bring friends.   Pros: Lively during sporting events. Beer is priced pretty decently. Multiple screens for sports games. Food is a little pricey. Live music on Friday nights. Starts at 7.   Cons: Seating. May be tough to find a seat during the dinner rush.   Overall. Cool vibes.  
                  While I&#39;m relatively new to San Jose, San Pedro market is a great place to grab food with friends or even as a couple just due to the volume of choices. I like it that there are two &#34;barns&#34; full of stalls that basically represent food truck or a food court type of setup.   It&#39;s nice that in one place you can get a salad, pizza, and a crepe for dessert - perfect! The area also has great seating indoors and also outdoors with individual and communal tables. During the day it&#39;s nice to be outside in the sun and in the evening the lights come up.   Overall a nice place for a quick dinner - casual with a group of an informal date.  
                  So glad that this is in San Jose. I&#39;ve been going since they first opened. OPTIONS!!! Love that we have so many options here. Great place to hang out with your friends and family in a very social setting. Crowd is friendly and a nice vibe. Will continue to enjoy SPSM.  
                  Great place with communal sitting, great drinks, drama free, and amazing friendly people. A must visit if you&#39;re in the area!   Cheers!  
                  Love this place. Indoor and outdoor seating, good beers, poutine, vegetarian options, cookies, and they validate the parking for the structure next door.  
                  San Pedro Square Market... what&#39;s not to like? An unexpectedly busy market hall with lots of food options, bars, a live music venue, and outdoor seating! And since it&#39;s all-year sunny in San Jo let&#39;s take advantage of it!  It&#39;s not really inexpensive in there but you&#39;ll get everything you need for one hella good evening right here. Start off with your pho, followed by a super-sized burger, topped with a slice of pizza, mixed with a burrito. Head on to the bar to grab a beer, listen to the live band jamming next door, walk over to the second market hall to sit down, do some people watching, and repeat the same thing. Or, throw in some sushi and ice cream.   Lastly, all good conversations involve some wine and sometimes even more wine - end your evening right here, at Vino Vino. San Pedro Square, let&#39;s make this a regular happening.  
                  Once upon a time, the downtown San José scene was really ghetto. Well, it still is. But San Pedro Square Market made it considerably more tolerable for a night out.  If you go back about half a decade, downtown San José was a sprawling, spread out concrete jungle. It offered the highest concentration of guys with dreadlocks, cornrows, shaved heads, tattoos, gold chains, gold teeth, neck fat, back fat, goatees to separate necks and chins, fledgling amateur rap careers, illegitimate children, multiple baby mamas, felonies, warrants, gaudy jewelry, Jordans, baggy jeans, STDs, speech impediments, cars with designs all over them, and bad pickup lines.   I&#39;d bring up the women, but there wasn&#39;t many in good ol&#39; downtown Man Jose. However, the few that did graze around downtown traveled in herds of women with tattoos on their necks, breasts, and ankles of various male names so they would not forget the name(s) of the father(s) of their children. Sometimes, they had butterflies that got so stretched out so bad they started to look like orange hearts with polka dots on them. And hearts that got stretched out so bad they started to look like red butterflies.  Anyway, downtown was a mess and the San Pedro Square Market helped clean it up. They did so by trying to shut down clubs in the area down, namely Taste, so the aforementioned men and women in the area wouldn&#39;t drive up from Salinas, Hollister, Gilroy, and Morgan Hill to get a taste of the &#34;club scene.&#34;  Once Taste was shut down, they built San Pedro Square Market and it helped revitalize the downtown scene.   These days, it&#39;s pretty much the go to spot to get your evening started. It&#39;s a central meeting point that offers craft beer, wine, cocktails, and an assortment of tasty food options. Essentially, it offers everything, but women. Sadly, San José needs a miracle for that to change.  You are free to travel around the market with your food and drinks and enjoy your evening without the fear of being stabbed because you accidentally stepped on some Jordans.  Anyway, if you haven&#39;t been to downtown San José in a long time, this place is pretty much the reason to try it out again.  
                  This place is pretty cool. I&#39;ve lived in San Jose my entire life and just discovered this place thanks to a friend.  There is a large variety of places to eat and drink inside and even a few little places to shop. I visited around 4pm for an early dinner/late lunch so it wasn&#39;t super busy since it was an off time. It started getting busier when we left. But there&#39;s a lot of different places to choose from to eat and drink with most of the places being affordable enough for a college student on a budget. There seems to be plenty of seating indoors and outdoors (with heat lamps!) and bars you can stand around at too.  Also, if you park across the street in the structure, you can get your parking ticket validated inside which means free parking!  
                  Huge fan, food, drinks, music, hangouts. Enjoy a beer outside in the sun? This is a great spot.  
                  Yes, I love it here. It&#39;s basically a really chic food court with a bar. There&#39;s a huge variety food and drink to enjoy, you&#39;ll definitely find something!  There&#39;s a parking structure right next to it, and you can usually get validation from the bar.  
                  Such a fun place! Great selection of food and drink and love the live music. Finding a seat can be a little difficult but it&#39;s still a good place to grab a drink or just hang out.   Park across the street in the garage and get validation at Treatbot.  
                  I&#39;ve always heard great things about San Pedro Square Market, so I was excited that we dropped by here for lunch over the weekend.  We tried tacos from La Loteria - specifically, the seared ahi tuna, portobello and chicken. The tuna was unfortunately overcooked - a disappointment since I was really excited for some yummy seared meat with that signature rare interior. On the other hand, the portobello taco was great. I love that they serve complimentary chips and salsa with each order. We also ordered the fried plantains with sour cream &amp; craisins and churros with chocolate sauce - both were absolutely delicious, even though they took the kitchen a little longer to prepare.  The vibe at San Pedro Square is great - we had a great time, and I definitely hope to return here next time I&#39;m in the Bay Area - especially for beers at their sports bar.  
                  Finally ventured to DTSJ to check out the Market that I&#39;ve heard so much about &amp; we were not disappointed! We brought some out of town family with us who are familiar with the Anaheim Packing District (similar concept) and we were are very impressed. There is a great selection of food and beverage choices, and what we thought was ample seating. At first I thought the fact that there were two separate buildings (one on either side of the outside patio) was going to be bothersome, but it was actually nice. We found the back building (along Almaden Ave) was less crowded than the front &amp; found a nice big table for the six of us to sit. Some of the food places provide buzzers so you can go back to your table and wait for your food, but others do not. Everyone was pretty happy with what they tried (baked potato bar, taco bar, Calidog, Bray Butcher Block, Treatbot), and the beer selection was definitely a hit in our group. Prices seemed quite reasonable as well.  There was live music in the area on the corner of St. John and San Pedro (it was a Fri night - they&#39;ve got the music schedule on their website), with lots of outdoor seating available (there was indoor seating too but they were full). We would&#39;ve liked it a little more if there were heat lamps outside though. Also, I was very happy to spot the parking validation machine by the taco bar, so we made sure to make that our last stop before heading to the cars parked in the San Pedro garage (you have 15 minutes from the time you validate to exit the garage), so parking was free for us.  This is a great place to hang out with friends for low key dinner &amp; drinks and we&#39;ll definitely be back.  
                  I love going to San Pedro Square!  They&#39;ve got a crepe place, a coffee place, a falafel place, an Italian place, a hot dog place, a taco place, and a couple of bars in the first building. Plus a sushi place, a burger place, a beer selling place, and an ice cream truck in the second building. What more could you ask for?  Want huge seating sections, complete with music, tvs, and heat lamps for outdoors? Got it. How about an area for live music? Got that too. A large parking structure nearby? Yep. A bar that validates if you even just step into the building? O yeah!   San Pedro Square is a nice place to get all kinds of food for decent prices and a fun place to just hang. There&#39;s always something going on. One weekend afternoon I spotted a chess tournament going on next to B2 (great coffee by the way).  My favorite spots in the Square include: B2 Coffee (yummy and coffee art!) Konjoe Burger (possibly THE best burger and fries joint ever!) CreParis (try the smores crepe!) Treatbot Ice Cream (ever changing unique flavors!)  I&#39;ve been here a few times and still look forward to trying more of the places!  
                  Great location.  Before heading to a Sharks game, I wanted to pop into Showroom for a SJ Sharks hoodie. When I stepped into the building and courtyard I was blown away by how many options were around. Seating was plentiful. Food options were varied and fit every palette. Full service bars.   The outside patio area was already crowded with pre-game attendees but it had a cool vibe. It felt like a backyard party with your friends.   We wound up coming back after the game to grab food and the open stalls were basically two - pizza and crepes. The pizza was what we chose as I am not a crepe fan. If more food stalls had remained open late then this would have been upgraded to 5 stars.   As a bar and general spot to chill, this is amazing. Also, having Showroom there with their awesome SJ based designs is a serious bonus!  
                  What a great hidden gem!  I&#39;ve been to the street many times but never ventured into the square.  I was really happy I stopped by for lunch.  Its a like a food court but the selections are a little better than a mall food court.  Ample seating indoors and out, with quite a few selections, your bound to find something for everyone.  There is also a full bar. Lots of fun.  
                  There are so many choices of food here, and it&#39;s really accessible as it&#39;s in downtown San Jose! But the food isn&#39;t that great and it&#39;s pretty expensive for the quantity (and quality) you get. I&#39;ve come here for happy hour once with my company, and I&#39;ve come here plenty of times with friends. It&#39;s nice because there are so many food choices within close proximity; everyone&#39;s bound to find a food they want. The alcohol selection seems to be pretty wide as well. Not a bad place to hang out, but not the best to eat a great meal or drink great alcohol. It&#39;s also pretty dirty, as there&#39;s a lot of people, and the space gets pretty packed. For parking, you can park in the garage on the other side of the street from this place, and you can validate it at San Pedro Square (just ask or find the ticket validation boxes that have a blue and yellow P on them) for free parking!  
                  This is definitely one of the highlights of downtown San Jose!  Imagine a fancy food court with a variety of wonderful food stands to check out. Food ranging from Vietnamese fusion to crepes to Mediterranean and poutine! I&#39;ve been coming here every week for the past couple of months and still haven&#39;t tried everything. I have been impressed with everything I&#39;ve eaten.   The atmosphere is great, and I&#39;m sure once summer hits, the outdoor patio that divides the Market will be packed with groups sipping on beer or sharing a delightful bottle of wine.  
                  Woo hoo, go San Ho! The San Pedro Market is such a refreshing, fun variety of great food and lots of room for you and your people to find your spot. Indoor or out, craft beer or local wine, whatever you&#39;re craving, it&#39;s here. Casual, fun, reasonable and delicious  
                  Quick history lesson: San Pedro is the Spanish language form of Saint Peter. According to New Testament accounts, Saint Peter was one of twelve apostles chosen by Jesus from his first disciples. Originally a fisherman, he played a leadership role and was with Jesus during events witnessed by only a few apostles, such as the Transfiguration. According to the gospels, the confessed Jesus as the Messiah, was part of Jesus&#39; inner circle, thrice denied Jesus, and preached on the day of Pentecost.   A square? I THINK NOT! Anything but.  That aside, San Pedro Square is a blessing for downtown San Jose. If Santana Bro had a younger/more hip/less pretentious brother, it would be San Pedro Square. He wouldn&#39;t judge your music, he would bring a bottle of wine to your house warming and he would shake your hand like a man; whereas Santana Row would show up drunk, shot gun some natty ice and shit on your front lawn.  Are you still following? No? good.  Upon walking in, you&#39;re greeted by what looks like a hip mall food court.  With restaurants, bars and hell, even a barber shop at every glace... it can be deemed as overwhelming. What I find weird is that many businesses&#39; inside the said &#34;square&#34; (which is more like San Pedro rectangle AMIRITEGUYZ!?) put a hip spin on simple foods; which I tend to find annoying.  Cali dogs? They&#39;re hot dogs bro. Dac Phuc? DA PHUC KINDA PHO IS THIS!?. On a roll? A-white-persons-spring-roll.... Don&#39;t kid yourself. If you&#39;ve made it this far, you&#39;re probably thinking &#34;what a hater! Why a 4-star review then, hater?&#34;  What it comes down to, is San Pedro Square has something for everything. Every type of food imaginable to satisfy your picky palate, great (full) bars with attentive staff, MARKET BEER CO. OFFERING THE BEST DAMN BEER SELECTION THIS SIDE OF THE MISSISSIPPI and one of the best patios in the bay area (if you&#39;re lucky, they also have live bands on nice days). You can take your pho, Belgian wheat and hot dog out on to the patio and listen to some tunes. I mean really, does it get better than that? Minus the forthcoming diarrhea.   Unlike pretentious Mantana Bro, San Pedro square is unpretentious, caters to EVERYONE from single bros, couples, families, the weird cat lady down the street and everything in between.   My jealousy is off the charts that San Francisco doesn&#39;t have something like this (yet) so in the meantime, ill trek on over and take full advantage of what it has to offer.  Saint like? I think so!  
                  Remember the impression you get when someone says the two words: &#34;food court&#34;?  Things that come to mind: sticky floors &amp; tabletops, teriyaki chicken samples, non-authentic Mexican food, sandwiches, Hot Dog on a Stick, dirty restrooms, etc. Literally, it was that place you&#39;d stop to get a quick lunch when you were famished from shopping at a mall.   Well, that might have been the case when you were growing up. Heck, that is probably still the case in most places, but this is NorCal, people. And it&#39;s a lot of NorCal stereotypes all in 2 little food courts! Yay!  Erase ALL that you thought you knew about food courts. San Pedro Square Market has a lot of diverse food, drinks &amp; desserts.  You&#39;ll find &#34;make your own&#34; slushie alcoholic drinks, fried chicken and waffles, artisan + sushi tacos, Venezuelan arepas, yummy desserts, hipster coffees, sea salt chocolates &amp; ice creams, etc. etc. just to name a few off the top of my head. There&#39;s something for everyone here!   I love how clean it is, and the variety of different vendors here. Great to bring a group to, but it&#39;s not that cheap. You&#39;ll spend $20 here easy, so be prepared! Fun place to stop by if you&#39;re in San Jose and don&#39;t really know what to eat!  
                  The most lively and happening place in San Jose. The only thing is I wish it were open until later.. But k guess people in San Jose go home super early hah.  Grab a cookie and a beer and sit outside chii  But be sure not to smoke a cigarette.. San Jose smokes less per person than any other city in the US  
                  I like San Pedro Square as it has something to eat for everyone! There are multiple restaurants located here serving cuisines from Mexico, Middle East, China etc. My favorite is the Falafel place where their Chicken Shwarma (BBQ chicken rolled in sort of a tortilla or pita bread) is quite delicious. There is a full bar with beers on tap too. There is seating both inside and outside. It&#39;s great to sit outside in the fresh air while having lunch. This is a great place to have a team lunch. We have visited a few times from my work also.   Overall, a place with a variety of cuisines at reasonable prices.  
                  Like everyone has said, it&#39;s definitely an upgraded food court type setup. It&#39;s a fun atmosphere to take family and friends. Booze and hot dogs?! Don&#39;t have to tell me twice!  
                  Friend recommended this spot to me, when I was in town attending an event at SAP, and I was NOT disappointed.  Lots of amazing options. Craft beer? Coffee? Breakfast? Lunch. OHHH YISSS  
                  A tale of two markets...San Pedro Square.  Brilliant during the day, especially during farmer&#39;s market.    Douche patrol at night.  And that&#39;s how it went down during a recent visit with a friend from the city.  On a whim, I challenged her foodie sensibilities and changed plans from Teske&#39;s to San Pedro Square Market.  This was a new experience for me as well for never have came here before in the evening.  Although douche patrol, the hipsters and swagger baggers were subdued.  Quick bites included Little Chef Counter and their rendition of poutine.  Noticed that the Earthquake wasn&#39;t on the menu, but no matter.  Our paper plate of well cooked fries, gravy and shredded pork was fulfilling. Both of us, having been to Canada before, attest while not faithful to recipe up north, that this version is delicious.  The let down was the bbq joint next door.  It was the mac n cheese that killed it.  My ribs were gorgeously prepared meaty bones slathered in sauce.  Unfortunately the texture and taste wasn&#39;t to my liking or perhaps more accurately, not something I&#39;m used to.  I&#39;m tend to expect ribs to be more toothsome.  My friend just picked at the tri-tip.  Good thing there was karoke at Treatbot.  Btw, I hate karoke.  Her benefit, not mine.  Despite all of this, there are more places to eat in and around San Pedro Square.  Exploring is the fun!  
                  This is very different.  San Pedro Square Market is it!    We came here at night and they had music going.  The weather was good as well like it was early Summer.. they had a bar immediately upon entrance.. I had a beer, pretty good beer.. we walked around with our drinks and explored the market; they have a pizza place with pretty good looking pizza, a few fusion places inside and then outside in between the first and second buildings, there is a courtyard, where people chilled on the picnic tables and benches like it was Summer.  This is definitely a good alternative than to do the same ol&#39; bar hop or a typical night out in the club or lounge.  Heard this place is pretty new too.. was just established a few years ago.  Man, San Jose got it going on!  Oh yeah, the second building had a few more food places inside and a mini club lounge as well.  
                  This is a GREAT place. Whether you want to get some lunch, dinner, happy hour, or have a good fun/ratchet night, this is the place to be! For a night out on the town you can have a perfectly good night just here at San Pedro Square Market.  There&#39;s 2 buildings and there&#39;s an open courtyard/patio seating area in between. They have live music there too every once in awhile before 10pm. One side of the market has a crepe, Viet fusion, wine, pizza place, and a full working bar for drinks. The other side has Blush seafood bar (also full bar there), craft beer place, Treatbot for ice cream, Korean fusion burgers, a dessert/pastry place, Mexican food, American/BBQ? food, and they&#39;re opening a Potato Corner as well.   Lots of seating area, whether inside or out, but do sit outside, they have lights strung out above and it&#39;s just really cute. The ambiance is fantastic!  There&#39;s a huge parking garage across the street and they validate parking too! Unless it&#39;s a really busy Saturday night, they will collect a flat fee of $5.  Not in the market, but on the same San Pedro Street there&#39;s an Irish pub, Old Spaghetti Factory, Old Wagon, Firehouse, Peggy Sues. So if anything in the Market isn&#39;t to your liking, you can always just walk down the street.  
                  I have to say, I like this place. Despite the hipster vibe, it&#39;s really, really fun.  It&#39;s just a big couple of open air buildings with different eateries in them. Lots of awesome food. I like that you get to pick wherever you want to go, and the rest of your party can eat wherever THEY want as well and you can all sit together like it&#39;s some sort of far hipper food court!   Did I mention that there&#39;s a full service bar in the main building? That alone should make it five stars. My wife and I love to take our son on the occasional weekend. We each get to eat wherever we want, grab a couple drinks and all sit in the middle part. As for dessert, there are several options as well.   All in all, it&#39;s actually a really cool and fun place for all ages. We will return many times!  
                  This is definitely one of the fancier public markets I&#39;ve been to. They have great choices in restaurants, desserts, and even bars.   Although I haven&#39;t tried it myself, I heard parking is free with validation.   The service you find at each location is so-so. I haven&#39;t been wowed at any particular place at this location. Everyone just does what they are suppose to do. Nothing more and nothing less.   There is quite a few seating options around. The &#34;band&#34; area, which is also know as the middle outside area, is usually packed. The indoor areas that are near the food are also always packed. But I usually find tons of seating near the coffee shop and on the outside area near the bar.   The food option here is amazing. They have everything from Greek, Thai, Burgers, Pizza, Hot dogs, and so much more. They also have ice cream and an awesome dessert place. So much to try and not enough room in my stomach!   Overall: I think this is a great public market to try out. Would definitely recommend coming here.  
                  PROS:  Community community community!!  REALLY!!  It&#39;s that first!  You&#39;ll see when you arrive how amazing this little jewel is... &#34;LITTLE&#34; well, NO it&#39;s fantastically huge!!  Order from maybe 15 or more vendors!  Grab your meal and sit either inside or outside to, basically a community table or find yourself a table to eat on your own!  Bring the kids!  It&#39;s by far, in my opinion, better than Santana Row!!  Just feels homey!!   CON&#39;S:  It can get crowded and hard to find a table... just have someone find a table while you order the food!!  
                  I love San Pedro Square Market! I feel like if there is one thing to do in downtown San Jose, this is it! I highly suggest it to any visitors of the city.  I love that there are so many options for food and drinks. Not to mention, that every single one I&#39;ve tried so far I&#39;ve been more than pleased with! I think that this is an excellent place to spend an afternoon with friends, or an early evening. It is not a place for late night partying, but that&#39;s the charm.  
                  I come here a lot...I mean, if you&#39;re from SoBay (South Bay) you&#39;ve definitely been here or will be going once you&#39;re 21+.  I love the open space that connects the two main indoor parts of the Square (food and bars), and this is a prime location for people watching! I&#39;ve been here for a chill catchup with a college friend to the most recent big event here...OKTOBERFEST! All experiences have been super fun and there&#39;s usually not a lot of seating for the amount of people that come here. But if you beat the lunch/dinner rushes, you should be able to find your wooden stool in the lazy sun.  This is one of my fave spots to grab a beer and talk or just enjoy a lazy Sunday morning.  
                  SPSM is a great place to meet-up with friends.  No one has to agree on a restaurant.  There are a ton of options, especially if some people are eating and others are just drinking.  It can be difficult to get a table outside on a Friday or Saturday night, so plan ahead.  The music can also be very loud, so sit as far away from the stage if you don&#39;t want to hear the music.  There is also indoor seating, but why?  There are heat lamps for cold nights, and being outside is relaxing.    I&#39;ve been to almost every counter in the market, so check my profile for additional reviews.  
                  People, we have a legitimate place to hang in San Jose. STOP THROWING SHADE.  I know this joint has some room for improvment, but it&#39;s a really super duper good start.  FOOD ============== Most of the food is quality munchie food, with sprinkles of healthy and sweet.  Here&#39;s my take:  Robee&#39;s falafel-love the chicken plate when I&#39;m trying to be sorta healthy.  Blush-The Club within the market.  Good oysters,  happy hour, comfy seating, and decent people watching-again it&#39;s Man JOSE.   Little Chef-Sometimes they sell out, and I hear everyone raving about this spot.  When you want a good burger and greasy poutine fries, this.   Pizza Bocca Lupo-In the mood to share with friends?  Why not share a pizza? As long as everyone can make up their mind on what they want, you are golden.   Treatbot-the 408, horchata, and  mint chip ice cream are the bomb. You can&#39;t deny the craving.   Bray-when you want a good salad with some legit meat-carne asada skewers, YES.   Chocatoo-because those chocolate chip cookies served HOT are too hard to miss.   SHOPPING ============  It&#39;s limited, but local.  If you need a &#34;I LOVE SAN JOSE&#34; shirt, you are sure to find it here...among other things.    I like the Ay Dios Mio joint. It&#39;s where I purchased a cool Day of the Dead SF Giants shirt.  Winning.   Again, cool spot.  The only kicker is seating.  Trying to find a seat is like exiting the cafeteria lunch line at high school. You look around and hope for a seat, but you are doomed if you aren&#39;t part of the cool squad with a homie reserving a spot. Seriously, I was on both ends of the spectrum. I was the one giving the evil eye to someone just sitting their drinking their wine, and I was taking my slow arse time eating my FATTY fries.  Karma.   Either way, cool spot and parking is VALIDATED.  
                  + Good for groups + live music + plenty of space, lots of variety of food/drinks  - closes early for area (12am) with only a small portion open until 1am  Came here for a friend&#39;s birthday and it was super fun! Great area in general for drinks and relaxing with large groups. They have plenty of outdoor seating with picnic bench style seating and it doesn&#39;t feel like anyone is &#34;in your space&#34; and there&#39;s xmas lights to light up the place--gives it a good vibe.  Drinks are fair price, but not the cheapest...I guess that&#39;s to be expected from bars though and especially as the area is kind of the ONLY places to go to for decent night life in San Jose. So I still enjoyed it a lot! Depending on the day, there&#39;s different bands that&#39;ll play so check out their schedule, they&#39;ve got some good sets! I&#39;d definitely come back for group events in the future, thanks for a great night!  
                  Very cool and great energy!  Great place for hanging out all sunday during NFL season.  Was here last year during the 49er&#39;s playoff game and even found great seats near the Market Beer Company and TV&#39;s all around us.  Excellent beer selection at Market Beer Company.  Very knowledgeable and hands on chefs and servers, and all the beer and food (great huge garlic chicken wing plate or more platter, pizzas, lots more) is relaxed but upscale trendy.  Lots of parking across the street and on street if you&#39;re there at the right time.  Can&#39;t wait to get there again!  
                  Fun place to grab some food and kick off a pub crawl.  Lots of options for food and drinks, lots of different price points.  Alot of open air and open space makes for a relaxed feel.  Definitely a good hodgepodge of people here.   PROTIP:  Outdoor patio area / beer garden is a really nice spot to enjoy a microbrew on nice afternoons.  
                  I had no idea how much this area had changed.  It&#39;s awesome, and it&#39;s unique. Never saw anything like it.  It&#39;s like a food court, but it&#39;s almost like a village indoor market with vendors of all kinds.  There&#39;s all sorts of food: burgers, Thai, pizza, drinks, Mexican. It&#39;s really quite cool and hip.  They have live music at times and it&#39;s just really well thought out so that the original space was used and the area preserved. Really impressive.  I got two shrimp tacos that came with a side of fresh corn strip chips and a pineapple drink.  The food was served fast and there was plenty of seating. People were cheering on the soccer game on the huge flat screens.  The parking might be a pain. I was at my old job location and we walked over, but there&#39;s metered parking and lots too.  
                  This place makes me feel instantly more grown up, in a cool classy sort of way.   The only time I have been is on lunch breaks at my internship, because it&#39;s a real easy walk down the street from most other things happening downtown (including our office). Most of my life I&#39;ve dreaded working surrounded by office buildings, but San Pedro Square is a nice little refresher for a day in a cubicle. It&#39;s a pretty open and appealing space, with a range of table sizes for bigger groups or just a few people. During the day there are a bunch of people sitting around, but I&#39;ve always found seating and never had to wait in line for anything. I can imagine it getting crowded at night, especially with all the events listed. (Their event board also uses chalk, which for some reason makes it instantly more appealing).   All of the food options really make it though, I love having so much delicious in one place. We can go as a group and everyone can get what they want. It&#39;s like a food court with the upgrades of actually have good food, with healthy and delicious qualities instead of just fast easy things. Most of the places I&#39;ve tried the workers are friendly and the food is fulfilling, even if it is kind of pricey. From hot dogs to crepes to spring rolls to pizza - it&#39;s all there.   They also have those water jars filled of fruits everywhere were you can get free water. I don&#39;t know if the fruit actually makes the water taste better, but it makes me feel like it tastes more refreshing. So that&#39;s neat too.  
                  Great different choices! There was a lot of different choices to go to. The atmosphere is great and the servers are super nice at all the different places. It&#39;s super empty during happy hour so getting a table isn&#39;t hard. Even if you have a super large group you can still totally get enough tables/chairs together. You can get an item from three or four different places and share all family style. There&#39;s outdoors seating area as well. Not bad. AND ANOTHER SECTION ON THE OTHER SIDE...WHATTT didn&#39;t realized that until my friends and I went to go get beers. Mind blown the seafood was on the other side. There&#39;s a dessert place right in the middle.  
                  This place can get crowded, however, it has loads to offer, especially in terms of alcoholic dispensaries!  It is a bustling place to meet friends and go for a pint, and grab a bite. They have hot dogs, dessert places, some bars have some bites as well. A little something for most people. The selection in beer is also really quite nice! Hard alcohol is also reaslly vast in terms of selection.  Prices vary throughout the San Pedro Square Market, but for the most part, it&#39;s not really all that cheap, so be prepared to spend a little more than usual for a pint and food.  Overall; a fun experience just being here, and it is relatively big with plenty to offer. Prices do vary whereever you go.  
                  The place to be in Downtown San Jose for casual eats, cocktails, beer, wine, and coffee.  Lots of options from seafood to pizza to tacos to Vietnamese to burgers.  Highly recommended.  
                  If you&#39;re looking for a fun place to go, definitely come here! When you enter the market, there are many different places where you can eat different things, which is super cool! We had some fried pickles with chipotle sauce that was delicioussssssssssss!  Get a table at the bar real quick! There are small tables you can take apart for a smaller group or you can put more tables together for bigger groups. The bartenders are OKAY. They&#39;re quick, but they only thank you if you get a BIG tip, if you give them anything less, you get your drink and nothing else!   Prices for drinks is pretty good! I can remember that (don&#39;t quote me): Midori Sours are 6$ (so yummy) Cosmopolitans are 8$ AMFs are 14$  The women carded (probably because I&#39;m a girl) but the men did not. There are really good vibes at this place! It&#39;s loud but not too loud!  (Ladies! Lighting for pics is not the best but they&#39;ll do :))  If you&#39;re in SJ, come here for a good night!  
                  What an awesome space they&#39;ve created in downtown San Jose. Community space, food stands, bars and coffee shop in one, there&#39;s something for everyone and plenty of space for it. I&#39;ve been for a happy hour where everyone can get their drink and food of choice (beer, wine, cocktails, tacos, pizza, burgers, vietnamese plate and cookies at one table!)  The World Cup games made the whole place seem like a huge sports bar. Very reasonable prices and something for everyone. Will definitely be back  Now only if they&#39;d develop something like this in SF!  
                  I love this place. My go-to spot when I&#39;m in downtown San Jose.  There&#39;s tons of food places and chill spots plus they offer a great beer selection.  During summer or sharks games i&#39;m here all the time.  
                  I really like safe, public gathering spaces where people can sit around and talk to each other.. Nice indoor and outdoor seating with heat lamps, lots of security, bathrooms are fine. A friend broke a glass and 2 people were on it very, very quickly.  I&#39;ve been pretty lucky with street parking in the area too, but even the lots aren&#39;t bad at 5-8 bucks for the night.  
                  This place is awesome!  Make sure you check out the whole space as there are numerous buildings/nooks and crannies.  There&#39;s something for everyone here so if you&#39;re trying to meet up w some picky eaters for dinner, this would be a good spot.  We got the tri tip from the BBQ place and it was soooo good.  I even liked the coleslaw and I am not normally a coleslaw fan (warning: it does have cilantro in it). We also got a burger from the Korean burger place and it was decadent and delicious.  San Pedro square has plenty of outdoor seating so it&#39;s a great spot to catch up w friends and enjoy the weather!  
                  I like this place when visiting San Jose.  There are a lot of great food options and a lot of great options to grab a beer a chill.  I&#39;ve come here a few different times before going to a sharks game, and the square has a nice vibe to it as there are usually a lot of people in their sharks gear drinking up and excited for the game that night...I&#39;ve also just been walking around San Jose on a few occasions and wondered into the square and saw live music playing which was nice too see and experience...the spot where you can pick your beer out of the fridge is a neat spot for beer lovers by the way as they have a great selection and some local types from the surrounding areas...  
                  Cool place to come get food or drinks. Place was packed for a Wednesday night. Parking was ok to find. We came here to try out blush. I thought Blush was its own restaurant its actually inside the market area. Reminds me of a food court.  
                  I love this place ..   It is divided into two main buildings .. plenty of seating throughout ! Great beer at the main bar .. great food options .. !!  
                  As my daughter put it &#34;this place is Fresh&#34;. In mom words, this place is refreshing.  Very hip, trendy, and abundantly filled with great food and beverage options.  I love the outdoor seating option and the live music gets an A+ for sure. My husband and I have come here a few times when we couldn&#39;t agree on dinner because at least here there&#39;s so many options that we both end up happy and full.  The atmosphere is geared for both families and singles alike. Casual yet you wouldn&#39;t feel out of place dressed up either. A little something for everyone. I&#39;m already looking forward to coming back as the weather warms up on the weekend and just soaking up the sun while noshing on lots of yummy bites. Oh, and the fresh baked cookies smelled SO GOOD!! Gonna grab some of those next time too.  
                  I can&#39;t believe that I never knew this place existed!!  Love the vibe at this place; it&#39;s set up with a ton of restaurant stalls and each place have the impression of a stationary food truck with freshly made menu signs or chalked of their wall.  A lot of families and friends hang out. It wasn&#39;t as apparent that I was in &#39;Manjose,&#39; but if you&#39;re looking for that... there are a ton of people hanging out.  I love that this place has a ton of seating and lights streaming throughout the courtyard. They also had heat lamps everywhere outside.  It&#39;s a good place to hangout with a group of friends. There were even people studying because the place has free Wi-Fi.   I&#39;ll be back to explore!! :]  
                  If you live in the South Bay or are looking for a reason to hang out down here, San Pedro Square Market is the place to go! This has definitely become one of the better go-to places for my wife and me, since we moved to San Jose about a year ago.  Here are the best things about San Pedro Square Market:  1) Trivia night on Monday nights at 7pm! This has become a weekly staple for us. We bring our coworkers and friends for Monday Trivia Night, and it&#39;s always a hit. There are always about 40 teams competing, and it&#39;s always a great experience.  2) The various food options from which to choose: Taco Bar, pizza, Mediterranean food, Vietnamese, Thai, specialty hot dogs, custom burgers, crepes/desserts, etc. Depending on your food preference, they probably have a vendor there who is serving up what your stomach is calling for.  3) Great outdoor venue during Spring, Summer, and Fall as well - there are tons of benches, tables, and seats outside. During the Spring time, you can bring friends, grab some beers, and spend time outside in the beautiful weather. There are also bands playing on the stage outside during the weekends! If you go when the weather is a little bit colder, there are heaters spread out, so it&#39;s not impossible to sit outside during the colder months...  4) Flat screen TV&#39;s showing all of the sports games everywhere - both inside AND outside. We&#39;ve been here multiple times to watch college football games, NFL games, NBA games, hockey games, and there are a ton of other sports fans that come out too.  5) Multiple bars inside the venue. San Pedro Square Market is split into 2 main buildings, and there are at least 3 main bars from which to choose, along with a specialized/custom beer and wine refrigerated section of classier imports.  I only have a couple minor complaints about San Pedro Square Market:  1) The Market closes super early at around 9pm!! WHY?!?!? If this place stayed open until 1-2am like the rest of downtown San Jose, this place would have more people in it staying until close than any other bar around that area.  2) During trivia nights on Monday, there is extremely limited seating in the Garage Bar section. Trivia night starts at 7pm, and teams start reserving tables as early as 5:30pm. I don&#39;t want to get there 1.5 hours early just to reserve a table so I can play in trivia night! There is the section outdoor that they used to keep open during trivia nights, but the manager there (not sure what his name is) decided not to open it up anymore. WHY?!?!  These are my only minor complaints. Love coming here every week, and there&#39;s always a lot of people having a good time hanging out, watching sports, grabbing food, and enjoying some drinks. Free parking validation for the parking garage as well, which is definitely a plus. Anyway, I&#39;ll be back here quite often. It&#39;s definitely a hidden gem in downtown San Jose. Don&#39;t miss out!  
                  I got to talking with my barber here at San Pedro and he was giving me all the background information on this awesome joint. The planners wanted an urban night market for San Jose-ians to hang out. They wanted something that gave off that feeling of living in a big city, but still keeping it local to the populous.  I think they&#39;ve done a magnificent job. I honestly don&#39;t remember what vacated the area here prior to the market being built, but I&#39;m so glad that by the time I&#39;m able to drink, it&#39;s here.  San Pedro hosts a variety of retail shops, bars, restaurants, and seatings for all of your weekend pleasures!  Here&#39;s a heads up, you can park at the garage right across from the Market, and get your parking validated here.  Enjoy!  
                  San Pedro Square Market, how I love the! For real, I have had so many parties here because I love it that much! Where do I even begin? The bars... yes, that is BAR-S-PLURAL!!! They have a large bar in the main area with a badass mirror (seriously who had the juevos to buy and hang that thing) and then a bar in the big warehouse-ish area where they host trivia... What is that? Trivia you say? Yes, they host Brainstormer Pub Trivia every Monday. Then on Friday and Saturday they have LIVE MUSIC... I told you, this place is the bees knees!  They have outdoor seating and have heater lamps for when it gets chilly. They have TV screens everywhere for the sports enthusiast so that you can go out and STILL catch your favorite game. There is a back area with another bar and a beer market! Are you drooling and/or in heaven yet??!? They also have many restaurants back there and even more seating? Too good to be true? NO WAY! Go check it out. Any time a friend asks where to go for dinner, for a party, for fun, or for some food SPSM is my number one answer!  It doesn&#39;t get any better than this, folks. Go check it out NOW!!!  
                  Absolutely love visiting San Pedro Square!! It&#39;s filled with wonderful local, diverse vendors! I love trying out something new each time I visit and I have never been disappointed. It&#39;s always filled with great energy and I just love it&#39;s atmosphere and the way it&#39;s designed. It&#39;s a must to stop by especially if you&#39;re in the downtown area!!!  
                  This block of restaurants and eating spaces in downtown San Jose was a real treat.  Our group was able to individually choose what to eat and then sit down together in the public market seating area.  Besides the indoor spaces there was a nice shaded courtyard for outdoor eating - nice space for kids or your dog.  We were fortunate to get metered street parking right at the corner of Almaden and Saint John St.  The Friday Farmer&#39;s Market closes down San Pedro St during lunch and walking among the vendors was a pleasant diversion where we found some nice bites.  The Sukhi&#39;s tent had a good selection of their packaged curries and we samples their bottled chutneys and pickles.  There was a poke bowl tent that tempted us but we could not resist a pack of freshly fried falafels.  The restaurants on San Pedro set up al fresco tables and looked like wonderful places to enjoy lunch.  We chose the dining options in the public market closest to our car and were really happy to share some sushi rolls from Blush Raw Bar and burgers from Konjoe Burger Bar.  The cold brew iced coffee from B2 Coffee was also terrific.  The only thing we missed out on was trying dessert from either Chocatoo or Treatbot.  Everyone we encountered treated us nicely.  That was especially appreciated since we were visiting from out of town.  Im looking forward to trying more of the food options here during their happy hour or early evening in the future.  
                  I&#39;m a big fan of variety and community, which correlates to the San Pedro Market. It has your vino vino, raw sushi (blush), Mediterranean, Mexican, American, Korean burgers, Vegan, coffee and it accommodates to the sweet tooth market--creparis, treat box and a pastry place. I&#39;ve tried most, if not all, but my favorite items are:  Sushi tacos from Blush raw food lounge Pimps cup from the Market bar Mushroom taco from taco Ahi tuna taco from taco  Basil Mozzarella prosciutto Neapolitan style pizza from Pizza Bucca Lupo (it&#39;s a male name I can&#39;t remember)  Taco Sushi: You get 3 light crunchy tacos arranged with avocado &amp; crab, seared ahi tuna &amp; cucumber, and another fish ambiance. My Japanese palate is satisfied cause I rather go fusion than faux-Japanese dining experience &amp; be served sushi / sashimi &#34;rolls&#34; and expect some spiders and overly sauced raw fish which I absolutely have issues with 78% of the time. It delivers a non Japanese raw food style that kind of shifts my ideas of sushi as they don&#39;t pitch themselves as sushi but a fusion raw food lounge ;D I am a sushi snob, so I won&#39;t call it sushi but it&#39;s living up to their statement! Good fish so far too. I try not to get sushi or sashimi though cause I&#39;d start comparing ;)  Pimp&#39;s cup: nothing like what it sounds! Idk why they even call it this since it tastes like cucumber &amp; strawberry spa water with little to no sweetness except for the natural tastes of the fruit/veg seeping into the water. You get a slice of cucumber at the rim &amp; a splash of liquor. Great for light weights but still has style!  Mushroom &amp;/or Ahi tacos - nice guiltless muncher (or so I think) and comes with chips. Get two tacos cause 1 might not be filling. Also, if you like fried plantains, than check this place out!  Pizza - awesome &amp; satisfying savory taste even for meat eaters. Sure, it&#39;s prosciutto but that&#39;s nicer than baked bacon imo thinner but it doesn&#39;t get hard as bacon and definitely not the salty salami taste you find with standard pizzas. Topped off after baking with wet mozzarellas and basil leaves. Oh please top me off &amp; I&#39;ll skip away to my bench! But, I have to say PBL no longer serves gluten free options :-(  
                  I&#39;m the first to admit I know nothing about San Jose. So I was very surprised to find such a cool little spot in the area to hang out in on Friday night. I love that you have the communal feel in the building while still having a nice roof over your head so you don&#39;t have to worry about weather. I also like the wide variety in food and drink options, though when we went a lot of the food stands were closed.   The bars were super packed and we knew we&#39;d have a hard time finding a table or seat, or even hearing each other in conversation. So we ended up in the wine bar area, and it was funny how much the vibe differed from the more rowdy front bar area. Something for everyone, I guess! It was much more civilized and quiet, we were able to sit at a table right away, and we got a lovely charcuterie and cheese selection to go with our tasty wines. It was a great way to spend a Friday evening!  
                  I love this place since there&#39;s multiple options to choose where you want to eat, and they&#39;re all pretty good! This concept comes in handy if you can&#39;t exactly agree on where/what to eat with whomever you dine with. The only negative is that it can get really busy and crowded, so it can be difficult navigating through the crowd, and also finding a seat.  
                  I&#39;ve watched this grow since it opened. What a great concept! I come here at least 3 times a week and that doesn&#39;t even count my morning coffee at B2.   It has made downtown San Jose much nicer  
                  I have gone to San Pedro a couple times and its a great place to grab a drink and some dinner after a long day at work. The bars they have, make some strong drinks and there is a variety of food available inside. I recommend going either after 7 or get there before 5 to find a table, but usually even in rush times, you can find a table sooner or later. The ice cream truck is a great addition to the different variety of food available there. The BBQ stall is usually the busiest but from what i&#39;ve hard, its worth the try. There is also Back-A-Yard across the street which makes amazing Jerk Chicken, so I highly reccomend going there before or after and enjoying a meal. Great place to check out, just wish it was an even bigger space.  
                  I LOVE THIS PLACE!!  What a great addition to downtown San Jose!!  This place totally reminds me of Faneuil Hall Marketplace in Boston (Quincy Market)... except, dare I say... BETTER!!   Although I have heard of this market place, I have never been, until the other night.  My boyfriend and I took off on a bike ride Saturday afternoon and ended up in downtown.  Riding around, we decided to try and find a place that we can park our bikes and have a beer outside.  SPSM was the perfect choice.  We had such a nice time sipping our beer, people watching and just taking in the atmosphere.  We ended up finishing up our beers and then decided to grab dinner.  We decided on a Chicken Pad Thai dish at On A Roll, which was OUTSTANDING.   As we were sitting in the courtyard I made a comment to my boyfriend about how kid friendly this place was and it was nice to see families enjoying themselves and children playing.  I will definitely be back here... with and without the kids.  
                  I&#39;ve been here for class field trips (oldest house in San Jose along with other historical buildings), art group get-togethers (plenty of table space for supplies and socializing), live music, lunches and dinners. There is enough food and drink variety to keep just about anyone happy. It is a great gathering spot.  
                  Who doesn&#39;t love a place where there is a variety of food and a great hang out spot?   I love this place! It&#39;s always so hard figuring out what to get. Vietnamese food, pizza, Greek,Mexican so many choices. They even make it hard to find a dessert since they have ice cream,crepes, cupcakes and and more assorted treats.  It&#39;s get pretty packed at night time on the weekends. But it&#39;s a great place to be if you don&#39;t want to be in a bar  
                  What a cool spot to hang out in a very casual atmosphere.  Lots of choices for food, big screen tv&#39;s to watch the games, open space, and lots of seating options for people watching (my favorite).  While we didn&#39;t have dinner in here, I couldn&#39;t help but stop by Chocatoo to pick up a few desserts.  I reviewed that place separately on here.  Next time I definitely want to try one of the restaurants.  
                  I first stumbled into this place when I was in town for a work conference.  I was using my yelp app to look for a place to enjoy dessert with my colleagues.  I was so grateful to yelp for turning me on to this place.   It is a cool space with various options fit for a foodie.  Its a brick and mortar cross with food truck vibe.  When you walk in, you will see a variety of vendors with options for most every taste.  The property consists of a couple different buildings all connected with a spacious outdoor space.  It is the perfect spot for a bite with friends. it offers a full bar option as well as a couple of beer and wine spots.   You have wine, beer, ice cream, pastries, crepes, pork belly burgers, tacos, pizza....options are endless here.  If you are with a group that can&#39;t decide on what to eat, its perfect as you can all meet in the middle after you have made your selection.  
                  I&#39;ll probably update this review once I go to an event here, but if I don&#39;t (update or ever go on an event here), sorry!    Ooh boy, what&#39;s not to like about San Pedro Square Market?  I take my friends here if they&#39;re ever being indecisive brats.  And they usually find something they like, although they will begrudge me for the price.  Hot dogs, tacos, pho, and even poutine - this place has it all.  And with both outdoor, indoor, and large communal tables for groups and socializing, I haven&#39;t really had a problem with seating.  Definitely worth a visit if you&#39;re feeling peckish, or just want a quick place to stop and grab a bite or beer.  --  sweet: lots of tables, tasty food, tons of variety. bitter: the *official* san pedro bar sucks, can be a tad expensive, and they have these awkward eighth-tables that you can&#39;t do anything on in the middle of the aisle.  oh wait.  Maybe they&#39;re dividers?  Dang.  
                  This place is always busy and has sometimes bands or solo&#39;s playing music or singing.   Love the food selection here, I was invited to a last day party for a co-worker and I was excited to go here and check it out since I would bike around downtown San Jose and pass this area a lot back when I was young.   Place may seem busy but, the caters keep the area organized and clean like staff coming around the area just picking up done drinks or trash from your table area and when you order food, you are given a small vibrating notifier to tell you that your order is ready. That makes it better for those people who don&#39;t want to stand around for 10 minutes waiting for their order but, instead that they can just go back to their group and hangout.   Place is beautiful at night with the lights on and heaters in place for those who are cold, there&#39;s like 3 huge indoor areas to dine and one outside where bands and singers stand.  
                  Variety of food choices with a beer garden. Parking and finding a table for your group is a struggle though.  
                  Once a week, AT LEAST, I find myself at San Pedro Square Market. And with all the time that I have spent there, I have yet to grow tired of it. Food, drinks, desserts, entertainment, coffee, it&#39;s got it all. It&#39;s a food court for adults with style and sophistication. That&#39;s how I describe it to people.   I won&#39;t go into detail of every place, they each have their own yelp pages, but I will tell a bit about the set up. Like I said, it&#39;s like a food court. There are different individual restaurants; they are just the store front, no or VERY limited seating that belongs just to them.(blush is an exception) Seating is open through out the entire place, inside and out. There&#39;s plenty of tv&#39;s to watch whatever game is taking place and 3 bars. They even have live music certain nights.   It&#39;s a great place for groups because it has something for everyone. You don&#39;t have to waste time trying to find a place for the majority, that still leaves a couple people in the group unhappy. Everyone can go and choose what food and drinks they want and bring it all together. A very chill place great to hangout at. And if for some reason you decide you need a haircut at that very moment, there&#39;s a barber shop there oddly enough!  
                  This place is my go to place for a good time. I love coming here just to relax, have a couple of drinks with a few friends, and if I&#39;m there early enough, grab a bite to eat.   The pho you find at San Pedro is soo legit. This place is ran by a Vietnamese family. Next door, make sure you try the pork belly burger. It&#39;s delicious. Or your could get some bbq. Right in the middle, you&#39;ll see desserts. I&#39;ve never really bought anything there. It&#39;s extremely overpriced. If you&#39;re craving ice cream, there&#39;s a permanent ice cream food truck in the back.  What better way to wash all the food down than a bottle of beer? The beer market is on the other side.  The have ample amount of varieties you can choose from.   Outside seating allows for me to bring my puppy. But if you&#39;re outside during dark, watch out! GIANT cockroaches rise up from the sewers! I might be exaggerating a little but they really are huge!  
                  I have been here a couple times for both drinking and eating (not both at the same time).  Every time I have enjoyed my time here.  It&#39;s a great place to hang out with friends.  The drinks are good, and I love all of the choices for places to grab a bite.  There&#39;s a little something for everyone!  Pizza, tacos, hot dogs, Vietnamese, falafel, etc.  So far I have tried the Vietnamese place (On A Roll) and Robee&#39;s Falafel.  No complaints here!   There&#39;s also lots of seating options both indoors and outdoors.  The outdoor lighting is satisfactory by night so you aren&#39;t stuck inside where it&#39;s cramped.  If everything were indoors...you&#39;d never get to the bar.  Thankfully, it&#39;s not so.   Stop by San Pedro Square Market next time you&#39;re around.  I highly recommend it.   Oh...and there&#39;s a bathroom if you&#39;d had a lil too much to drink.  ;)  
                  So many great restaurants and great variety of food to choose from.  I love to eat and hang out there and people watch.  Try On a Roll (Vietnamese), Chocotoo (desserts), and Treatbot (ice cream).  Konjoe is on my list to try.  Heard great things about that place.  
                  Great food options and lots of seating indoor and outdoors. There is something for everyone. Homemade pasta, pizza, Korean, arepas, salads, French dip, desserts! That&#39;s just what I remember. We will definitely stop by again and suggest this place to others.  
                  This area is probably the hands down reason I&#39;d come back to in San Jose to hang out.  What can I say about?  It has such a big selection of venues to choose from to eat, man oh man if you had an event where you can taste everything, give me a call!  :)  It&#39;s a cool place to chill, as it has outdoor and indoor spots, with a live band playing as well.  From desserts to savory, there&#39;s something for everyone here.  I like the atmosphere and it seems to be packed frequently.  Well done, if I&#39;m in the area again, I&#39;ll definitely hit this spot.  
                  I live nearby and spend a fair amount of time at SPS Market. I&#39;ve never had a bad experience. It can certainly get crowded, but the people are the friendliest in the bay area. The arepa place is great, and as not too many people know what it is, it&#39;s usually a bit less crowded. But their food is the best. Lines can be long at other places, but all are well worth it. Usually Thursday - Sunday it stays pretty lively, especially in the summer. Grab a bottle of wine and go sit outside and listen to some live music!  
                  We noticed this place while eating at SP2 over the summer, and the patio area in between the 2 buildings reminded of a beer garden - lots of people, beers and drinks, food, live music in the summer.  I really like what they&#39;ve done with this area.  It&#39;s like a much fancier version of a food court that actually serves alcohol.    It&#39;s nice when you go with a lot of people because everyone can get their own things but still sit together.  It&#39;s still nice to be outdoors during the day when the sun is out, but I definitely want to come back in the summer when it&#39;s warmer in the evenings.  
                  I absolutely LOVE San Pedro Square. There are many different eateries and variety that it&#39;s seriously the best choice for medium to large groups. It&#39;s also great for girls night out, date night or you name it. Live music, drinks, and great food and I&#39;m a happy woman. I don&#39;t know what else to say about this place other than its my go to most times.  
                  This place is awesome, great food and beer. The only reason it&#39;s 4 star is because of the delay of the TVs. Would not suggest watching sports games here because you&#39;ll hear a crowd cheer and then another cheer 5-6 seconds later.  
                  Thus far I have found decent parking in the area. The Market has enough TVs and food options for a large group of rowdy teachers to get together to kick it or watch a game. I have yet to eat anything that has steered me in the wrong direction. Plenty of outside and inside eating (tables, stools, standing up, long tables, booths etc.).... plenty of places to get both non alcoholic and adult beverages...  My biggest grievance are not enough bathrooms for the amount of folks present. Never fails the women&#39;s restroom is gross, lacking toilet paper or soap etc..    BUT.... I love the fact I can get Poutine here. It by far is my favorite thing to get when I am at SPSM. The Siracha fries are a close second...  
                  I am ashamed that it took me so long to finally check out SAN PEDRO SQUARE MARKET. I live in San Jose, and sort of avoid downtown - but SPSM is an absolute gem.   They have two buildings full of small restaurants and bars - think something between a &#34;Food Court for adults&#34; and the Ferry Building in the City. I went with my wife and I had Konjoe Burger and loved it, and she had The Bray and she loved it too. They have a great beer selection for the beer snobs, and plenty of wine options for the winos. It is definitely a casual and fun place. I&#39;ll be back!  4.75 stars  
                  I had my My Best Friend Wedding (the movie) moment at this place..it is the scene* when Julia Roberts received a call from her friend during the wedding reception and she thought he is back in NY. And if you saw the movie you know what happened next. =)...  This place is huge!!!!   As others pointed out they have stage for live outdoor performances and lots of tables and chairs!!!  Inside is a food court which reminds me of the SF Ferrry Building food court/ Emeryville food court.  The food court have variety of stuff from Vietnamese to Italian.  I had the banh mi at the Vietnamese place and it was good and the service was good too....staff at the patio takes order of your drinks and she was efficient.  My first time here at this place was an UYE with some SBC Yelpers....  **the scene  youtube.com/watch?v=DDds…   
                  Cool place to hang out and chill. Great restaurants, bars and coffee shop. I love to come here just to relax and enjoy a beautiful weather by myself or with my kids. Wish we have more places like this in Silicon Valley.  
                  Awesome place to come to after work and just relax and have a few drinks with good company. There&#39;s a bunch of food places to grab a bite. I would recommend their taco bar- their chipotle shrimp taco was spicy and delicious. Tons of seating outside.  Since it&#39;s downtown, there are plenty of other bars/restaurants that are within walking distance, so you can make a whole night of it.  
                  San Pedro Square Market holds a special place in my heart.   Parking is usually not too hard to find on the street. There are parking lots and garages nearby but we always manage to find something within a couple of blocks.   Seating inside is a different story. A year ago, there weren&#39;t as many restaurants open so seating wasn&#39;t and issue. These days, you&#39;ll have to sit outside if you aren&#39;t lucky enough to grab a seat inside. They have heating lamps, but they don&#39;t keep it turned on very high. After we adjusted our lamp, someone came by and turned it back down.   PIzza Boco Luppo is my fave place here. Get a drink at the bar and you&#39;re all set.  
                  This little square is a fun little spot to hang out and try different deserts, beers and cuisines.  This is very close to the San Jose, CA airport and very convenient to stop by, grab some food and watch some football. The atmosphere is like a food court, complete with locally owned vendors. There is a craft beer bar, hamburger stall, Vietnamese, new american, etc. A little something to satisfy everyone&#39;s cravings. The place is very clean and there are plenty of places to sit and catch up with your friends and family.  There is a covered parking garage conveniently located across the street. The parking is free if you get your parking card stamped. **MAKE SURE YOU STAMP 15 Mins PRIOR TO LEAVING**  
                  Drove up north to visit my cousin and she insisted on taking me to the San Pedro Market Place. On first impression, the market place can definitely get crowded. The day we went there was a Bruno Mars concert nearby so I&#39;m sure that contributed to the amount of people there. Luckily there are parking structures and lots nearby so you don&#39;t have to waste time searching for street parking. In some of the structures parking can be validated so make sure to bring your parking ticket with you!   The San Pedro Market Place consists of many eateries centralized in two main areas with indoor and outdoor seating. This is convenient in a sense if you can&#39;t decide on what to eat you can walk around until something appeals to you. There is a huge variety of food selection so eat to your heart&#39;s content. This place attracts a lot of people considering many of the eateries had long lines. So if you are coming hungry, be prepared to wait!   There is a nice area outside with plenty of seating where you can enjoy live music. Once it gets colder, I&#39;m sure everyone will be swarming into the indoor seating areas. With that said finding seating anywhere can be difficult. While sitting down enjoying dinner there were several groups of people scouting and waiting like hawks for tables and seats to open up. The market place does get loud, so if you are looking for a quiet night out, this might not be the place to go.   The market place is located in Downtown San Jose so if you can&#39;t find anything you like at the market place there are plenty of nice restaurants nearby.   If you want a casual day/evening out with either a few friends or a whole group of friends check out the San Pedro Market Place.  
                  Pour over coffee is delicious. Strong coffee satisfaction. Our cousin had told us about it. It&#39;s coffee at a whole new level.  
                  Little Chef Counter, Vino Vino, Bray, Treatbot, Blush,..you name it, I&#39;ve tried it!   San Pedro Square Market is probably the best thing that has ever happened to San Jose! I love it so much. Not only is the food great, the atmosphere is just so much fun. Whether I am on a date with my boyfriend, having lunch with a friend, on a late night hang out, need a place to kick back and study during the day, or if I need some place to watch the Giant&#39;s game or any other sport in season, this is the place to be. SPSM is perfect for every occasion. When it is a nice day, I recommend enjoying your meal outside. There is a lot of outdoor seating. I guarantee you will never be disappointed.   Recommended spots:  Robee&#39;s Falafels - Try the Falafel Wrap, Vegi Wrap, Hummus Platter, Falafel Balls, and/or the Fatoosh Salad. All are so fresh and delicious. Perfect for when I come here for lunch time.   Vino Vino - I am currently a vegetarian, but when I first tried Vino Vino, I fell in love with the brie, fig, and prosciutto panini. The brie is ooey gooey and the fig jam/prosciutto makes the perfect sweet and salty combination. It is flavorful and extremely delicious! Note that it is a heavy sandwich, but it is served with a small serving of arugula to help balance out the richness.   Blush - I suggest coming here for late night happy hour. The sashimi tacos, caprese salad, poke, and rose roll are the best! Everything was delicious. I also love that they have a seating area outside that is perfect for an intimate evening with the loved one.   Bray - My favorite place! I never thought I would eat here because I am a vegetarian and this place is a carnivore&#39;s dream. However, the vegetarian options offered are so good! Try the pear salad. It is not only huge but it is fresh and delicious. Whatever you do, do NOT forget to order the jalapeno and cheddar polenta! These are so unbelievably delicious! I order it every time I come to the square.  
                  I haven&#39;t been in this area of San Jose in YEARS. I am so happy San Pedro Square was better than when I left it.  Suddenly I have a dozen more food options.  I can get both Vietnamese spring rolls and French crepes in the same mall style cafeteria?  A million seats?  Treatbot serves here (South Bay ice cream)?!  Oh yeah sign me up!  The only ding is it can get hot inside.  Outdoor seating will save you when it gets hot in downtown.  
                  This is my new favorite spot in San Jose! Its an indoor market place full of take out restaurants, bars, coffee shops, baked goods, etc. All top notch gourmet places... They have a bunch of inside seating as well as a large outdoor seating area and some stand up tables along the middle. The bars have some seating as well which I found to be quite convenient.     This is a great place to go with a group of friends because you can all eat what you want and you don&#39;t have to worry about splitting checks. There is truly something for everyone here.    Ive only been here once so far but it resulted in five 5 star ratings!, I had the best burger ever at little chefs counter, the best S&#39;mores cookie ever at Chocatoo, the best cup of coffee at B2 coffee, had a beer with my burger at the market bar (best place to sit and eat a burger), and now the market itself (home to all this goodness).   I&#39;m a huge fan and I can&#39;t wait to go back!  
                  Love how San Pedro Square has evolved!!!! I was living nearby when San Pedro Square first opened up shop. I moved away for a year and come back and boom! I&#39;m so happy how much it&#39;s blowing up! It&#39;s a great place to go for lunch and dinner, especially if everyone is craving a little bit of something  different! They even have a couple of bars! Woo! Can&#39;t forget in the main bar they have huge TVs to watch games. They have coffee, crepes, any type of dessert, burgers, rustic oven pizza, hotdogs, Chinese, Mexican, Mediterranean...the list goes on! They also have an amazing barber with a badass chair. I love San Pedro Square.  
                  I love this place! I take out-of-towners here, as well as local friends. You can grab some great food, a beer and sit outside when the weather is fine; it&#39;s San Jose, so it usually is.   I adore Little Chef Counter, as they have a great selection, including tasty vegetarian options. The tacos next door are yummy as well.   For a fun night, after you eat, walk over to Blush for a late weekday happy hour. $1 oysters!  
                  What a lovely &amp; chill place to be at...  There&#39;s a great variety of different eateries to choose from if you&#39;re not sure of what to pick from. So far I&#39;ve tried Blush &amp; the Bar which was both great!   The outside seating area under the big tree is very relaxing &amp; great for conversations plus you get to hear music from either Blush or the other side that plays country music? Which is cool.. depending on which side you want to listen to upon your musical taste.  I really like the hummingbirds that are adorned on the branches of the big tree. It&#39;s so cute &amp; pretty &amp; unique! :D  Parking: pretty easy street parking; free meters after 6pm.  
                  I&#39;ve been here many times, but tonight was one of the few times when it was actually easy to find a place to sit. Sometimes the place is packed like sardines, and you have to stalk people and wait for them to leave in order to get a table - and then you&#39;ve got to be quick. But tonight there were plenty of available tables when my friend and I got there at around 6 pm. Pretty impressive for Friday the 13th. We got a drink at the front bar, and a little later we got some food at the Vietnamese place near the San Pedro Street entrance. I don&#39;t remember the name of the place. It just occurred to me that it&#39;s kind of difficult writing a review of a place like this, because I don&#39;t know the names of the individual restaurants within San Pedro Square Market. I&#39;ve eaten at quite a few of them over the last few years, but I couldn&#39;t name a single one. They&#39;ve all been good, though, and this Vietnamese place was no exception. I had a coconut chicken curry, and my friend had a chicken and veggie dish, and we shared some spring rolls. It was too much food, but it sure was good. We also got some drinks at the main bar. It was the first time I&#39;ve ever been able to walk right up to the bar and order right away without having to fight my way through a crowd in order to get anywhere near the bar, then spend 30 minutes trying to order a drink.   All in all, I really like this place. It&#39;s got a huge variety of food, most of which is reasonably priced. It also has alcoholic beverages and a beautiful, large outside patio, which is usually packed during the summer. I&#39;ve never been able to get a place to sit on the patio during the summer. But, it&#39;s understandable because it&#39;s such a cool place. They often have live bands performing on the patio on weekends, especially during the summer, but I&#39;m pretty sure they have bands year-round. Tonight was unseasonably warm for February, so the patio was packed, but not nearly as packed as it sometimes gets.   Tonight I had the easiest time I&#39;ve ever had at finding a table, ordering drinks, and ordering food than I&#39;ve ever had at any other time at San Pedro Square Market. I hope this doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s losing its popularity, because it is one of my favorite places in San Jose, even when it&#39;s so crowded I can&#39;t find a place to sit - I still like it because it&#39;s such a cool, unique place, and all of the food is good. I&#39;ve referred to it as a &#34;gourmet food court.&#34;  
                  This is such a cute place. From the street is really hard to see how big the market is. This is really great place to visit with friends who might want to try different foods. The pub inside the market has refreshing white ale. This is a great place to watch any kind of sporting event. On Saturday they have love music  
                  Great atmosphere to hangout with the guys, sit back [if you could find a table], relax, talk and listen to music. It is pretty packed on a friday night and it comes with a large selection of foods and bars.  I think this has got to be one heck of a place SJ has to offer, and wwill be the only place I can suggest to outsiders.  
                  This historic buildings in downtown San Jose filled with all kinds of small, gourmet restaurants and vendors turned into a great area to eat, drink and shop.   It&#39;s similar with Seattle&#39;s Pike Place market or Chelsea Market in Manhattan but much smaller scale and open booth concept with sharing common seating area both indoor and outdoor patios/tables.  Every Friday, a Farmer&#39;s Market places here with fresh produces as well.   It&#39;s definitely fun place to check out if you visit San Jose to grab a quick bite, a drink and shop around.  
                  Cool little spot to hang out and try several different types of cuisines food court style. I really wish we had more time to spend here but we were only here to kill time while we waited for our flight out of San Jose airport. It&#39;s conveniently located just down the street. We came on a Sunday evening and the place was practically empty. Plenty of places to sit and roam around. I could spend an entire evening here trying their wide selection of beers and spirits, grubbing at the various stands and just hanging out with friends. We only got to try the Asian stand called Phonomenal. Their ox tail soup was very good as were their seafood egg rolls. I also tried some of our friend&#39;s burger and pork belly sliders and they were equally as good. Not sure where they got them from. This place will definitely be a must stop by and try spot on my next trip to San Jose.  
                  It&#39;s hard to review this place as a whole because there are so many different elements to it and you can really customize your meal to what you want! It&#39;s basically a trendy/classy food court for anyone who isn&#39;t familiar.  There is a LOT of seating, but on busy nights or when there is a Sharks game on, seating can be hard to find.    The appeal of the market is that there is something for everyone. Multiple bars, pizza, salads, burgers, cheese plates, pho, an actual ice cream truck INSIDE and MORE! It is really fun- my boyfriend and I have very different taste in food and this place is great because we can have what we want and sit in a common area.   Some of the food, in my opinion, is more expensive than it is worth.  I ordered a beet salad at one of the booths yesterday and it was essentially a $10 pile of lettuce with a couple of yellow beets and 2 carrots. Kinda sad. Most restaurants would consider this a side salad. oh well.   The pizzas are ok, tasty, but a lot of money for a thin crust pizza.  
                  I love San Pedro! It is a great space to have an informal meeting and to meet people for happy hour. It is so versatile, I also come here with my boyfriend for dinner and beers. They have some great beers on tap and they switch them up somewhat often. They do have happy hour where they have $5 or $6 beers, not the best but it is a good spot to relax out. The bar usually gets a bit packed but moves quickly.   They have indoor and outdoor seating, plus tons of food options. Mexican food, Mediterranean food, pizza, hot dogs, pho, ice cream, salads, etc...  They validate your parking for the parking garage across the street, right next to the bar.  Come and enjoy the fabulous outdoor seating at the beautiful wooden tables.  
                  This market reminds me of a cross between Oxbow Market (in Napa) and the Ferry Building (in San Francisco).  It&#39;s much smaller than the Ferry Building and is basically a hipster food court (no farmer&#39;s market or fresh produce).  There are a lot of food options here, so it was hard to decide what to eat!  There&#39;s both indoor and outdoor seating, and parking in the garage across the street is free with validation at the Bar inside the market.  Why the 3-star rating? - because both of the dishes that J &amp; I ordered were subpar:  Cre-Paris has both savory and sweet crepes. I got the chicken/mushroom/cheese crepe, which is one of their most popular savory options. I paid a little extra to add tomatoes (trying to eat more vegetables!), and it also came with a side salad. Well, the crepe was mushy (no crispiness to the crepe), and the ingredients just tasted a little bland.  Robee&#39;s Falafel has a variety of Greek-type dishes. J got a combo plate with beef, chicken, falafel, and rice. The falafel was good, but the beef and chicken were both dry. Too bad!  If I lived closer, I&#39;d definitely return to check out more of the food options.  
                  5 stars.  San Pedro Square is my go-to when in Downtown San Jose. Great variety of food and drink. The have something for every crave, from crepes, to oysters, to BBQ, to dessert for those with a sweet tooth. The outdoor seating is awesome on a warm summers night. I love the chaotic mix of people gathering to enjoy the food, live music and company of friends and family. What makes coming here really great is the free validated parking. I never pay to park when I come out here.  Final Thoughts: Will continue to make memories at this amazing hotspot!  
                  Great place for groups to gather before heading out to the bars. The noise level isn&#39;t too high so you don&#39;t have to compete over other people to hold a conversation. They have TVs around so sports fans can watch. There&#39;s a decent amount of popular brews here. The line moves quickly and clean up is fast as well. Overall a great and more relaxed spot to be at until they close and you&#39;re ready to head to other scenes.  
                  -__________- sigh they took down my review idk why... so annoying...pooop  anyways yeah i like this place a lot during spring and summer because its still warm outside so you can sit out in the patio, which they share with Blush Raw Lounge on one of their entrances. They&#39;re always playing awesome music to just relax to on Sundays. Everyone is loud, laughing, and always have a great time. Atmosphere is so laidback!  The selection of food is amazing! ...lol dont bring me here because i already have a hard time being indecisive looking through just one menu, this place will be a disaster LOL. but besides that, they have an amazing selection of food. They have everything you could possibly want here. There are a lot of table and chairs that are inside. Everything seems very rustic with wooden benches and tables of the sort.   downside, it closes pretty early depending on the day ): drinks arent that strongggg. but if you just want a chill night with wine and friends, this is a great place to go  
                  There are so many things being done right at this place.  Many restaurants, open seating, and beer.  It&#39;s great for parties and large groups.  On weekends you may find yourself sitting outside, but they have finally addressed the issue of adding in more tables.  The whole place extends to 2 parts holding their own set of bars and restaurants that can please almost any palette.  They also host different bands/events throughout the week so it&#39;s definitely lively at night.    There isn&#39;t really too much to complain about this place, they have awesome validated parking for the structure next door.  San Pedro Square Market is really something different that hopefully sets a trend for other cities, think of it as a nightlife upscale food court I suppose.  
                  A totally love the concept of this place. Watch out Ox-Bo market in Napa this place is climbing the scales as the best all around market type food venue! I was not able to try everything but the pizza place they have there was awesome. Not greasy at all very natural tasting since I had the margarita pizza, the crust was out of this world and it is what stood out the most about this pizza. ----- Pizza Bocca Lupa   Oh and you have to try the duck fat fries I am so sorry I can&#39;t remember the place we got them but it was right next door to the bar inside the market.   Also the wine bar- which I didn&#39;t get to sit at since we all were seated outside- was beautiful and cozy looking. The cheese and meat platters were great for our party of six to share.  ---- Vino Vino   I really want to go back and try Robbee&#39;s Falafel!!!   I must bring all out of towners here!  
                  This place is great for hanging out or getting a beer. There are a variety of restaurants in this place and so much to choose from. Good selection of beers as well!  
                  One of the best places in SJ to chill with friends, eat lunch, or have a date. Live music plays often. Plenty of food and drink options. Parking is validated, and its walking distance from San Jose&#39;s busy 1st street. Must visit.  
                  I like this place because it&#39;s going out and hanging without all the fuss of getting dressed up and &#34;fancy&#34;.  It&#39;s convenient, the parking structure is across the way and after 6pm it&#39;s a $5 flat rate.  They have a bunch of different restaurants selling just about everything there, plenty of booze, and well if you don&#39;t want any of that La Vic&#39;s is still right around the corner.   And well, if you want to go out dancing or the rest of downtown, it really is just a walk away.  it&#39;s super close to every where else.  It&#39;s nice that they have people cleaning the seats and tables and clearing your empty glasses, but it&#39;s also weird that they are pushy about it and constantly insisting on wiping down table while I&#39;m still eating.  The seating is a bit sparse, if you&#39;re doing the earlier evening thing it&#39;s easy to find seats, but when it gets to be later... It may be standing room only.  Also, most of the food places have a water dispenser and cups for you to grab.  If you like fruit/cucumber/flavored water, most of the places throw that stuff in their water.  It&#39;s a nice trendy little spot that&#39;s close to everything else.  If you haven&#39;t yet it&#39;s worth checking out.  
                  This is a very night atmosphere, especially during the summer and nice nights.  There&#39;s a variety of different restaurants that you can choose from.  You just order your food and grab a seat.  The only complaint that I would have is the plastic tables and chairs they have.  I wish they could build more solid tables and chairs like they do on the one side.  It&#39;s always nice to hang out with family and friends here and it&#39;s outside in an open space where you can bring the kids to hang out as well.  They do have seating indoors, which we always go to when it&#39;s cold out.  
                  I am a big fan of this place. It&#39;s been newly renovated about a year ago and is now my top hang out spot in San Jose.   Inside this warehouse-like building you&#39;ll find a plethora of foods ranging from kabobs to ice cream to a wine bar. There is indoor and outdoor seating. Sometimes if you get lucky...or if you just plan accordingly, you can catch live music playing outside which is pretty cool. It&#39;ll give you that &#34;it&#39;s just one of those nights&#34; feel good kind of vibe.   If you still can&#39;t imagine what this place is like, just imagine an upscale food court with a bar. Btw if you&#39;re at the bar, Brian will take care of you with the drinks.  
                  I love this area and the good vibes.  If you are looking for a fun, casual night out with drinks and friends, this is the place!  There are many options for food but no item really stands out as a must-have.  The food is similar to what you expect from food trucks - gourmet and pricey - but, unfortunately, not that tasty.    On weekend nights and many summer nights, this place gets very packed. The outdoor seating is great, and on cooler nights, they turn on the heat lamps.  Great location to begin or end your night out in downtown San Jose (DTSJ).  PARKING: Validation is available for the garage across the street.  Bring your ticket with you, enjoy your night&#39;s festivities, drop by the main bar when you&#39;re ready to leave, and insert your ticket into the machine for validation!  
                  Cool market with not so bad parking and a great selection. I saw a section for wines, korean food, potato creations, arepas, and more.  Very clean with a family atmosphere and plenty of space to sit comfortably in historic downtown san jose.  Definitely worth a visit.  
                  I absolutely LOVE San Pedro Square Market! Best place to &#34;kick-it&#34;, catch up with friends or have a casual date, and watch sport games.  There are so many choices of food and the bar of course, is always a plus.  There is always a variety of people there and I appreciate the diversity.  The cocktail waitresses are very nice and not &#34;stuck up&#34; (that&#39;s BLUSH for you next door).  The only down fall is the drinks are a bit pricey and the food over priced.  However, the ambiance, lots of seating, and great variations (Beers, wines, cocktails, to all types of food and dessert) make up for it.  I just recently moved downtown and I love riding my bike here.  
                  It&#39;s like a food court for adult, which is GREAT but I must say that I had significantly higher expectation on the food items offered at San Pedro Sq Market (I read the raving reviews and the food sounded more awesome than what I found!).  After circling the place a couple times and couldn&#39;t see anything too exciting to try, I settled on Sriracha fries from Calidog and Crab sliders (2) and Smoked salmon sliders (2) from Sama Zama. A few friends ordered poutines from Little Chef Counter and many ordered delicious-looking pizza from Pizza Bocca Lupo. I must admit I kinda regretted my choice as they were just mediocre and the sliders were way overpriced. I would rather get a good-looking pizza, even though, it was just a pie!!!  I was hoping to try the bone marrow from Little Chef counter, but they didn&#39;t have it on the menu that night. The other food counters were just regular mexican food, gyros (a friend who got a gyro from the place said there were way too little amount of meat), sushi, hot dogs??!! I must admit that Calidog probably was the CHEAPEST thing that you could find there and the dogs looked pretty good. The sriracha fries that I ordered was just ok, I was hoping for a lot more sriracha kick though, so I was a little disappointed.  My sliders were good BUT it wasn&#39;t something that I couldn&#39;t make myself at home (and I&#39;m sure you could too!) and I felt like they charged arms and legs for such tiny things! They had this &#34;cheaper deal&#34; for ordering 4 sliders vs 2, so I asked if I can mixed them up, getting two different fillings (crab and salmon), the guy said &#34;YES&#34; but yet he still charged me 2 times 2 sliders prices, which ended up costing me a few bucks more. So I must admit that I felt a little bit ripped off. Also, at a food court, do you tip the food vendors? The Sama Zama dude asked for a tip, which I thought was kinda weird since the one cleaning the table was not the food vendors but the janitors hired by San Pedro Sq Market. I felt that I should have tipped the janitors/buss lady who religiously took away empty plates and cups from our table.  At the end most of us got a treat from Treatbott, the strawberry nuttella seemed to be the favorite so I got that. But again, I was disappointed as it tasted like a regular strawberry ice cream and I nearly tasted any chocolate at all.  It&#39;s certainly a great place for after-work hang out with friends. The place is not very crowded that you could seem to find a table to sit with your group. We had a group of 20+ people that night and we didn&#39;t have a problem sitting together.  If I ever go back here, I now know that I should not have a high expectation and that I should prepare to overpay for food and drink!  
                  It&#39;s a great spot with a full bar and different kinds of food to try - like a super nice and more upscale food court. It can get really busy on the weekends and/or if there&#39;s a game on. I had a few trivia nights here too that were fun. This is also a good spot for people watching: if you sit outside at the tables by the bathrooms, you get entertained in the evenings by the drunkards, the women trying hard to be desirable, the men trying to woo the ladies... pretty fun all around.   If you park at the San Pedro/Market garage, the validation machine is by the Market Beer Company. If there&#39;s a game or some event going on, then there&#39;s a flat garage fee (I believe) that&#39;s around $5-$10 depending on the event or if it&#39;s a playoff game. There&#39;s also street parking that&#39;s free after 6:00 p.m. and is free on Sundays. They added a rent-a-bike across the street and there&#39;s a few spots for motorcycle parking.  
                  I&#39;ve been here multiple times and I&#39;ve never ever had a bad experience. The food is amazing and there&#39;s a lot to choose from. Seating can get a bit tight during the weekend, but the patio area offers a lot of space as well...  
                  Best part of downtown San Jose.  Great food inside the market, great coffee at B2, and the BEST cookies in town at the bakery in the middle of the market.  Seriously....  
                  How had I never been here before this past weekend?  A prerequisite to living in the South Bay should be coming to San Pedro Square Market - it is seriously the BEST place in San Jose and will likely become my go to spot on weekends and evenings from this point forward.  So far, I have only tried the Cheese Shoppe and Market Beer Co. but I could tell that delicious food and drink were definitely a requirement towards having a spot here.    If you have not been here, you are absolutely missing out.  This might just be my new favorite place in the South Bay.  
                  A union of restaurants and bars? How can you not love it?! This place has a variety of different things you may want. You can eat at multiple places &amp; then you can drink.   I&#39;ve been to one of the classier restaurants in the area. It became a lounge at night with a small dance floor. They had specialty cocktails too. We definitely had a fun night but we would have dressed up a little more for this place. We went in jeans and a tshirt but people were all dressed nicer.   However, the other places were more casual. There&#39;s another small bar (Garage Bar) that had some beers. They have a few specialty beers on tap. I tried an IPA there.   It&#39;s hard to talk about all the places (I haven&#39;t been to them all yet either) but this area is a place you&#39;d want to come hang out for food and drinks!  Lastly, as an added bonus, it&#39;s about a 10 minute walk from the SAP center so it&#39;s a prime place for hanging out before a Sharks game!  
                  Went here today with a couple of friends during the day time. I loved the atmosphere. I ended up getting a great chicken salad from the vietnamese spot and it was delicious.  I enjoyed the spring rolls as well. but you don&#39;t come here just for the food, you come for the space. we got to sit outside and enjoy people watching and the sun. I am not sure if I would want to come during the night because i would not like the crowd and the loudness of it. It was a great place to get lunch on the weekend. very open and relaxing.. I can&#39;t wait to spend a few more sundays there!  
                  A great market. Not *quite* at the level of Oxbow or Ferry Plaza just yet, but it&#39;s on its way!  It has all the hallmarks of the above-mentioned markets: great local coffee; gorgeous (and pricy) produce, nifty ice cream from a local purveyor; cool art shops; wine bar; places to grab a bite to eat; sit-down restaurants; and more.  And yes, a farmer&#39;s market on Saturday, featuring all sorts of great vendors... and the requisite Folksy Musician With Amp.   Only downside is that downtown SJ isn&#39;t quite the attraction, in and of itself, as SF Bay or Napa.... though there are some historical points of interest nearby, which make for interesting investigations as you chomp your Treatbot treatpop or nosh on the cheese sticks you bought from Beckmann&#39;s stall at the farmer&#39;s market.   Plenty of parking (metered street + parking garage) nearby.  Worth a visit!  
                  This is one of my favorite places in downtown SJ. It&#39;s right next to San Pedro Square (duh), which already has a lot of different restaurants and food shops that make for a good lunch or a good evening hangout. The Market itself has TONS of great food options. Pretty much all the restaurants I&#39;ve tried in this square (and I&#39;ve tried at least bits and pieces of almost everything) are great. Sushi, drinks, ice cream, burgers, macarons, etc. are all fantastic.  It&#39;s very low key decor wise, but it&#39;s a great place to just hang out and talk with people. There&#39;s always been seating every time I&#39;ve come here. Also, I heard that they have live music playing on some days in the outside seating area, but I&#39;ve never had the chance to come. All in all though, one of my favorite places to meet up with friends when I have the opportunity.  
                  This place has improved drastically in the past two years.  They added another bar, which helps speed things up, and the bartenders now are friendly, attentive, and efficient.  They also have a menu of house cocktails that are much better than the original ones and tons of great beers on tap.  There are also a ton of food options here. A little pricey, but it&#39;s great because you can take a big group of friends and everyone can get what they want.    I&#39;m glad they worked out their issues and that I came back.  What a change...this is now definitely one of my favorite places in San Jose!.  
                  Love this place! Its a great addition to DT! It&#39;s the perfect spot to meet up with friends and grab a bite to eat or unwind with drinks!  I love that everyone can get what they&#39;re craving..but still sit down and enjoy the meal together... So far I&#39;ve eaten at the little chef counter, pizza and Mediterranean food and haven&#39;t been disappointed yet!   The main bar inside is a full bar but can get a little crowded during peak times or game days...there is a second bar that is smaller and less crowded but only have IPA&#39;s on tap.  I don&#39;t live in SJ anymore but whenever I&#39;m in town I always find myself here at least once or twice during my short visits...  
                  Somehow during my 5-day trip to San Jose in October, my friends and I managed to go to San Pedro Square Market 3 times on 3 different days! I was actually thinking there was nowhere else to hang out in the town!  The first night we were in town, we all met up inside the main cafeteria area and ordered drinks from one of the bars inside. There&#39;s plenty of seating indoors and outdoors. It&#39;s not too loud so it&#39;s great place to just chill with friends.  The second night, we went to the bars surrounding the market.  On the third day, we were there for Oktoberfest. They used the outdoor space to setup the beer booths and it was a good time all around.   Places we liked inside:Chocatoo for macarons and jumbo cookies! The Beer Market is also a great place to pick up a bottle to-go or to drink there.   It is definitely a good space to have since you can still hang out there if it&#39;s bad weather outside!  
                  As one of my friends eloquently put it: San Pedro square is like Pike Place market!    Minus the view.   Minus the fish throwing.   Minus minus minus ... LOL  Ok. The joke ends here or all you South Bay people will drop kick my ass back to SF ;p  San Jose is on the up and up with this square: plenty of outdoor/indoor seating, casual vibe, eateries like Little Chef counter, vino vino/blush ($1 oysters during HH), pizza bocca lupa and that falafel place. (what was the name?!)  Treatbox is a dream and make sure you get the Horchata, 408 and if the Jackfruit is available, get it! Skip chocatoo, I am not impressed.   Great space with lots of food and drink choices. Ok, San Jose, you win this time. ;)  
                  Love all the different options. Perfect place for a big group of people that can&#39;t decide on one cuisine. Live music on weekends. Really lively and fun!  
                  Dear San Pedro Square Market,   What you&#39;re doing is so cool! I love the hustle and bustle, I love the food and drinks. I love the expansive seating. I love that you&#39;re next to my favorite drinking establishments. You&#39;re a great place to meet a group and start the night. You&#39;ve got food, you&#39;ve got music, you&#39;ve got booze. How can you not enjoy things?   Love,   Me.  
                  Love this place! There are many different options which satisfies my appetite on any given day. The food is good and occasionally I make it to the music on the outside patio. Lovely!  
                  The best thing that downtown San Jose has going for it. Which isn&#39;t saying much, since San Jose is basically, after two years, a combination minivan factory and baby mill, as far as I can tell, with little personality to call its own.  But San Pedro Market Square makes me hate San Jose a little less. Quite the accomplishment, that.  
                  A much-needed upgrade and dose of energy in downtown San Jose reminiscent of the Ferry Terminal in San Francisco, but with slightly less upscale choices, although some of these, like Pizza Boca Lupo, are quite good.   There are stands for just about every cuisine you&#39;d want, several bar areas, and even stands for dessert and cheeses. Moreover, there&#39;s not only the main building on San Pedro Street, but also a second building with more choices in the back, behind the open-air courtyard, on Almaden Ave.   On a typical evening, this place is buzzing with activity, mostly from young professionals and young families - exactly the kind of upwardly mobile crowd in need of an upscale scene that San Jose should be doing more to attract.  
                  Like I told Jen C when I walked in tonight some serious story was unfolding:  Cre Paris was On a Roll tonight flirting with Pizza Bocca Lupo! Little Chef Counter was just a baby to understand what was going on. The Little Gift Shop was a witness to this all and The Bar was the reason why all these started. Well there&#39;s Vino Vino who&#39;s happy to stay away from the crowd but manages to connect with the party. B2 Coffee comes in with a shot of caffeine to wake everybody up to more party!  One big happy family!  
                  I love the idea of a communal space surrounded by an array of small eateries that all pump out some insane unique flavors.  Top that off with a great bar and an evening live band and you&#39;ve got an urban local hangout spot.  This place definitely transports you to a different place away from the lowdown showdown of SJ&#39;s downtown, the poser-opolis of the Row, and the douchbagery of Campbell.  It&#39;s a chill atmosphere with indoor and a massive outdoor seating area.  The majority of the foodie shops are located inside the building, with larger restaurants (Blush Raw Bar) located across the way.  Come in the afternoon and it&#39;s pretty quiet.  Very little traffic until happy hour hits and the live band arrives.  So many great options to eat, love, pray.   Eat.  a bit of each at all the amazing spots Love.  the summer sun with your pasty legs on the patio seating Pray.  that your 4-month food baby will birth itself within a few hours  
                  This place is hipster and fun.   Ever since it&#39;s opened it&#39;s been the togo spot for meetups, drinks and birthdays. It&#39;s like a modern cafeteria that offers a variety of eats from street food to fine dining. You can find Blush Raw Bar for girly girl drinks, seaweed hotdogs, freshly baked thin crust pizzas, french crepes, truffled fries, Vietnamese food, B2 coffee, etc. There&#39;s live music every now and then and there&#39;s also a hipster one seat barber shop.   There&#39;s plenty of seating area near the B2 cafe and there&#39;s seating outdoors as well which makes for great summer dining and drinking. Sitting outside for conversation can be difficult at times if there&#39;s a live band playing.   This is definitely a place I would take out of town visitors to or a place I would go to for catch-up and drinks with friends.  
                  A food, drink &amp; general merriment oasis in downtown SJ that provides a cheese-free social epicenter in an area that sorely needs it!  When me and the good egg moved to the South Bay from Brooklyn, we were desperate to find an authentic, non-cookie cutter, spot to hang for eat n drink and this ever-evolving space scratched that itch.  Pro&#39;s &amp; a few con&#39;s...  + Great warehouse space + Fantastic large patio w/ heat lamps + Large mix of large communal &amp; individual tables + Curated entertainment...lives music to trivia night to topic experts   + Diverse foodie options: sushi, noodles, burgers, poutine, bahn mi, crepes, desserts + Best pizza in South Bay bar none @ Bocca Lupo! + Worthy craft beer selection + Added Garage Bar  + Speedy free wi-fi makes it a great spot for the lap-toppers  - Main bar is always understaffed &amp; wait time can be lengthy (tip: hit garage bar) - Waitress service is basically non-existent - Spirits are about $1 more than they should be   - No Fox Soccer Channel on TV&#39;s to watch Champions League - Lines during lunch rush can long, best to come by 11:45 or after 1:30p  
                  Came to San Pedro square market for the first time today. And that too jut because I read about a love performance today. And I love this place!! It has everything you need for a perfect Friday night. Ambiance, bars, seating ( inside/ outside), food court. Perfect place to come for some family time or just to relax and hang out with friends!! Have a good weekend everyone!! :)  
                  Out of all places downtown,  I really really, love this place. Outdoor areas are pet friendly. Super chill place to bask in the sun. Food in the kiosks are cheap! And of course,  my fave B2 coffee is located here. Kai and I loce it here!!  
                  Love coming here! There&#39;s a ton of great places to eat or grab a drink. The ambience is really low key and it&#39;s a great place to hang out- both indoors and outdoors.  
                  I love San Pedro Square Market! This place is walking distance from my work and I love the variety of food there is to choose from. It&#39;s a fun place to go to grab food and/or drinks! There&#39;s metered street parking and also a parking garage across the street. Overall, a fun place to hangout!  
                  San Pedro Square Market is a lovely lovely place, very well thought after and extremely well executed with attention to all details. This is not your typical food court. The decoration and furniture are somewhere between the trendy/ hype to the casual and the food is somewhere between pseudo gourmet and the street food market food. The crowd is changing in each hour of the day and night and the atmosphere is changing with it. There&#39;s a time and a place and food for anyone&#39;s taste. In this twilight zone between the stylish to the functional the City of SJ managed to create the ultimate contemporary food court. It keeps moving it, keep pulsing, it&#39;s alive. I like it.  
                  Have you seen how gorgeous their space is???? Yes.. the one with the bricked wall; and high ceilings and beams and pipes?  It&#39;s my dream venue for a HUGE party. If my husband and I were to get married again; i&#39;d definitely rent this place out and have an industrial-vintage themed party.  There&#39;s so much natural light coming in...and just good enough space for let&#39;s say.. 150 people....  I&#39;m talking about the space behind the pizza place okay? That empty space.  Gorgeous gorgeous.  
                  This place is amazing all the shops are on the inside outdoor seating great bands play love it  
                  I&#39;ve been here several times through the past two years and I&#39;m finally finding time to write a review.  SPSM is always the starting point whenever my group of friends decide to go bar hopping.  I have to say that this is the PERFECT place to bring someone from out of town or a if you&#39;re planning a casual dinner with a group. Picky eater friends? Perfecto because San Pedro Square Market has something for everyone. If you can&#39;t be pleased by at least one of these restaurants here, you really don&#39;t belong on Yelp.   I always find myself at Little Chef Counter to get the bone marrow with crostinis as well as the duck fat fries. SO GOOD. Also, they sell the glass bottled coke. Yay!  Grab some drinks at the bar and head outside for group seating or go to the far right where it looks like a warehouse for indoor seating. Good luck trying to get a table close to the bar. If you decide to sit outdoors, the staff is very accommodating. We had a large group of 12 for my boyfriend&#39;s birthday and they moved the tables together and provided heat lamps.   Remember that there are two sides to SPSM, be sure to go to both before deciding on what to eat. The second area (where Treatbot is) is not as crowded and there are a ton of tables for four.   TIP: Park at the garage, it&#39;s $5 but you can get validation anywhere.  
                  A very cool and unexpected spot in downtown San Jose! This place is great for casual meet ups with friends and has food options for all. I thought the food was a bit overpriced overall and not all matched with associated quality.  
                  This place is Rad, it&#39;s like a food court for adults.  There are a hand full of restaurants from pizzas to pastas to sushi to poutine stand.  They also have some dessert places that serve baked goods and an ice cream stand.  For the first timers realize that it is actually two buildings and there is an outdoor patio in between where you can eat drink as well.  In the smaller west building there is a small side store that sells craft beers by the bottle(usually 24oz) and you can drink inside but if the weather is great take it outside to the patio and sip away!  
                  One of my favourite spots in all of San Jose! There&#39;s something there for everyone from great artisan pizza, craft brews, crepes, an ice cream truck with karaoke, and a lot more to give! The budget is higher than lots of places around, but the majority of the eateries offer food that is top quality with buddy, buddy customer service. The water has exceptionally sought out for with various flavored waters throughout: kiwi and strawberry orange -- yum! This is a spot to take your buddies out to at nighttime when the outside courtyard becomes a spot for everybody to hangout and revel in a great beer with each other.  
                  Why did it take me so long to discover this place! I think I am in love and I&#39;m pretty sure you will now find me here on the weekends! Nothing tops SPSM in San Jose......NOTHING! When I am here I feel like I have escaped SJ and it&#39;s a really nice feeling.  + There&#39;s a huge variety of food places here! I came here hopes to try LLC but it was closed in preparation for a dinner, but I was surprised to find a lot of different choices. I was under the impression that it was going to be more like Blush which has a restaurant feel, but these &#34;restaurants&#34; remind me of permanent food trucks. They&#39;re all unique and offer food that isn&#39;t really common in SJ. + I love that there is a bar in the market! It&#39;s so easy to grab a beer or cocktail along with your meal! Also there are servers who walk around in the seating areas in case you don&#39;t want to constantly get up and order.  + The tables outside are so relaxing and fun. Everyone that I have interacted with here has been so friendly! I love that they have a TV outside so you can watch sports. It&#39;s the perfect spot to be when it&#39;s sunny!  The only negative I really have is that finding a table during busy days (such as when there are sporting events,etc) can be a hassle. Parking is alright and according to my bf some places validate parking in the garage, but the day we can we decided to park at a meter versus possibly paying $7 in the garage. Hopefully the validation thing is true so I can be here all the time!  
                  In the past year, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s another place downtown that I&#39;ve frequented nearly as regularly as I have San Pedro Square Market.  This addition to downtown&#39;s cityscape was much needed and, in my opinion, revitalized the pulse and potential of San Jose&#39;s appeal. From workday lunches to Friday night revelry to lazy Sunday day-tripping, this hub is comfortably approachable and accessible to all types and interests. Where else in San Jose might one so readily see families in Sharks regalia enjoying rustic pizza while skinny-jean&#39;d hipsters talk music/bicycles/coffee and sultrily-dressed ladies gossip over swirly frozen cocktails all in one place?  The abundance and variety of food vendors and amenities contribute to the widespread appeal, where friends, coworkers, or cohorts can meet, eat, and seat in a communal space, exercising their individual tastes and leisure all the while staying together.   Largely, I think the communal setting is the greatest asset of this place. Either as a relatively intimate performance venue for some of San Jose&#39;s renowned and blooming musical talents or as a den of fandom for televised sports (GO SHARKS!), San Pedro Square Market is usual abuzz a few nights a week.  Greater than the sum of its parts. I&#39;m a fan, mos def. __________________________________________ How many places can you get a bit tipsy on a Friday night and feel right about taking parents to for brunch on a Sunday afternoon? Something for everyone, I tell ya.  
                  San Pedro on a Saturday night is a perfect spot for almost any occasion!  It&#39;s a great place for.... Date night People watching Girls night out Family dinner  Pros: * Plenty of food to choose from * booze at bars or pick a bottle from the menu * love music on Saturday (the people are actually good! I bought a CD for $10)  * not ghetto like the rest of down town &#34;man Jose&#34;  * servers are very attentive even if the place is crowded  * I recommend getting there by 7 to get a good seat * they have heaters outside, so you won&#39;t be chilly * if you get bored here, then you can walk to another bar down the street or the next street over   Cons:  Nada! This is now my fave hangout spot in San Jose! Woot woot!  
                  They need more chairs outside!. Or add benches to all the tables on the dirt area and save the chairs for backup.    I love the dirt area, so my kid can run around like a maniac with all the other little kids whose parents have the same idea. :)  Don&#39;t give your kid a shower before dinner here, do it AFTER you get home.   Just order a plain Margarita pizza from the pizza place and beer from the beer cooler spot and enjoy!   Most families leave by 8-9 or so, by then kidless people take over.  
                  The only places in San Jose I&#39;ve been to more than San Pedro are my apartment, workplace and Target. Let that sink in for a second. If I&#39;ve checked in to this place every time I went, yelp would probably categorize me as a functioning alcoholic with a burger problem (you have to try the It&#39;s a Burger at The Little Chef Counter).  This is the perfect place to bring out of town guests for a relaxing, low key night. There&#39;s two sides to the market, plenty of food options, and lots of seating, even for large groups. There&#39;s live music, movie nights, and is next to great bars and restaurants.  It&#39;s a great place to start a night, end a night (the restaurants close really early, so maybe not), or just bring the kids to enjoy the fresh air.  There&#39;s a validated parking lot across the street with lots of parking. Don&#39;t be hesitant about the $5 parking on weekends, tell the attendant that you want to validate it and they&#39;ll let you park for free.  
                  so much good stuff. great food choices.... it&#39;s like a mall food court for trendy adults. love the pizza place, taco bar, and the garage bar.   great place to hang out after work and on weekends. the bars give designated drivers free soda. you just have to tell them you&#39;re the DD and they&#39;ll hook you up.  
                  Love this new DTSJ attraction / hotspot.  Great atmosphere, very comfortable/clean/nice chairs &amp; tables, and lots of diverse food and drink options.. And of course, lots of diverse San Jose locals.    I love what they&#39;re trying to create here, with the pop-up retail spots, changing chalkboard menus, farmers markets, and of course the atmosphere that makes you want to just stay for a day and try a little bit of everything.  I guess you could call it a European-style market, but either way, I think it really works for this day and age, and I think the owners behind this are doing a great job at keeping the place attractive to all sorts of folks, and they&#39;re doing a good job maintaining it as far as it being clean and comfortable.  Can&#39;t wait to see more stuff coming here as this becomes a must-stop attraction.  
                  This place is great for breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, or drinks. There are so many different options that everyone can find something that they like and want. Great place to grab a drink before or after the sharks game too!  
                  Who doesn&#39;t love an indoor market place that has a ton of good food, no hustle of trying to split tabs, outdoor seating, and the occasional live band.   It&#39;s a cool, chill spot  
                  Very comfortable place to meet with clients. We met with a couple tonight and discussed their upcoming wedding and took a quick walk around to shoot some engagement photos!  
                  San Pedro Square Market is my go-to dining spot whenever I am in downtown San Jose area. It is great if you are with a group of friends. With so many eateries to choose from, there is always something for everyone.  What impresses me most is the quality of the food options. There are not one single chain franchise. Every tenant there is unique with a lot of characters.   The outdoor dining area is fun. Sometimes they have special event or live music.  
                  Nighttime and daytime this market is filled in the outside seating area. It&#39;s nice how you can order food inside, they give you a buzzer, you go back in and get it, and you can sit outside with your beer and food...enjoying the weather. The day we went there was a live band playing outside. Fun friendly people. Nice clean area to hang out outside.  We even brought our dog.  
                  Seriously my new favorite go to place in San Jose. I&#39;ve complained forever that there is no where to go on a Friday night in SJ...well not anymore!  I love to grab a drink and hang out here on the weekends with friends. It&#39;s just so chill. I love that vibe. I love the open concept feel. Good crowd. Just some good ole laidback fun.  
                  I love public marketplaces - I&#39;m a huge fan of the the SF Ferry Building one, the Oxbow in Napa, the Granville Island Public Market in Vancouver, and Seattle&#39;s Pike Place. SPSQ&#39;s Market is a great addition to downtown SJ - it&#39;s not quite at the same level as the places I&#39;ve mentioned in terms of selection and size, but it&#39;s getting there! I love the unfinished look of the space - the brick walls and the wooden beams on the ceiling (whether it&#39;s on purpose or whether they&#39;re still in progress, it looks cool either way). I like the seating arrangements, especially the standalone booths in the garage section.   I&#39;ve tried the food at Pizza Bocca Lupa (yum thin crust pizza), Little Chef Counter (sometimes really yum, sometimes really salty), CreParis (yum buckwheat savory crepes), Loteria Taco Bar (really fancy tacos), On a Roll (okay vietnamese sammies), and Blush (those slushie drinks at HH can be dangerous! lol). It&#39;s nice to have so many options - it&#39;s kind of like a gourmet food court! It&#39;s a good place to go with friends if they are super indecisive. And best of all, Treatbot is there so you can always get ice cream or treatpops for dessert and you don&#39;t have to chase down the truck. :D   I will be back to try the other eateries and can&#39;t wait to see what other new ones pop up.  
                  This place is usually busy and sometimes they have various bands and other artist play here. Usually I come here for the food. I have yet to drink at the bars here though. Usually my friends and I stop by here for dinner and then we head off to a local bar around the area.  San Pedro Square has a variety of food from  chili dogs, duck fat fries, tacos, spring rolls, crepes, and much more. The place is crowded at night, especially on weekends, so your best bet for parking is probably the parking garage. They also validate your parking tickets here.  
                  Love this place! It is so lively on Thursday/Friday nights!!!  We come here at least once a month for our monthly gatherings.   Great food choices for those who are picky--everyone can order whatever they want to eat. There are some good dessert stations too.   Wine and beer are served! We generally get 1-2 bottles to share, which comes out to be about $8-10/glass.  
                  Vast variety of food. You can sit anywhere and drink anywhere. TV everywhere. Heating lamps out doors and a great atmosphere. It&#39;s great for big groups. I love how it seems like it&#39;s a lot of new and innovative food starting up here. It&#39;s a hip place and it&#39;s casual. I really enjoyed my time relaxing here on a cold night. Can&#39;t wait to come back.  
                  Yes, this market has good food choices and seating capacity. It has plentiful indoor and outdoor tables and clean bathrooms. Good things for a busy food bazaar. What is pushing me to give 5 stars is not the food. It is because of Sam, the very muscular busboy/janitor for the market. He was very friendly, efficient, and productive. He proactively cleaned off tables as soon as customers built up any garbage and politely engaged them or their kids! As intimidating as he looked, he was very warm, smiling, and hardworking. He took pride in his job and added a very genuine service level to the marketplace. Mind you, this is not Sam&#39;s job it even expected of him. He could just get rid of garbage and would be meeting his job description. Above and beyond, he gives 100% more and still keeps an incredibly tidy marketplace. He was handing about 25 tables and keeping a smile on through it all. He demonstrated that success is not solely based on your title or salary but how much you love what you do! He&#39;s amazing! I told the General Manager that Sam made the visit special for my family...even moreso than the food. Let Sam know you appreciate him and his hard work next time you&#39;re at this marketplace.  
                  Why has it taken me so long to discover San Pedro Square Market? I walked into this large establishment last Friday for a Sharks playoff game and was in shock with just how much space was here. There are excellent places to grab food at, like, Little Chef Counter, On a Roll, Blush, and many more. There are also a couple of bar areas too. My friends and I were lucky enough to find a table in the Garage bar area where they had a huge projector set up for the game.   Beer was on point at the Garage bar, about 6 dollars each, and they had a huge list of whiskey to choose from. Outdoor and indoor seating for customers and bussers were walking around like mad men trying to keep the entire place in order. The crowd can get big and overwhelming which is what I felt in the beginning, but as soon as you get a table you&#39;re all set!  Can&#39;t wait to come back here to chill on a couple drinks and get some yummy gourmet food! This is definitely a new go to spot on the dtsj list!  
                  This approach to food is genius.  Bring together a bunch of tasty specialized counters.  Put a couple of solid alcoholic options, and spaces that can be used for gathering large groups or small, and let&#39;s see what happens.  I&#39;ve been here several times, and each time, I&#39;ve had a great time here.    I&#39;ve tried the food from the following businesses:  Little Chef Counter Cre-Paris Pizza Bocca Lupo Phonomenal Treatbot  I&#39;m a little obsessed with Little Chef Counter, but having options, and lots of space to choose where to sit is great.  I also think that Treatbot has fantastic ice cream, and Bocca Lupo has very good pizza.  If you want to feel crowds for a sports bar vibe, stay in the same building as the main bar. For a more quiet, relaxed atmosphere, the 2nd building is quieter.  They have a new bottle market, which is a large selection of bottled beers available.  I&#39;ve eaten on both sides, and even taken our baby with us, and he&#39;s fine with the quieter side of the buildings.  The outdoor section has movie nights and bands during the summer, so it&#39;s a great spot to congregate with friends, and everyone can get a little something they want.  
                  Nice market to chill in but I never know what to eat.  I think my indecisiveness goes into overdrive when I&#39;m here. I never know what to get because everything doesn&#39;t look that great. It&#39;s either alcohol, wine or some fancy snack that won&#39;t fill me up.  It&#39;s a beautiful venue and definitely a step up from before when it was pretty much a dump but none of the stores excite me at all like the Ferry Building in SF or Pike Place in Seattle.  
                  This place has transformed into one of the best places to hang out at in San Jose. It&#39;s like a fancy food court with a couple of bars, a cafe and shops! When I visited San Pedro square the first time, there was a live band playing outside so we walked in just out of curiosity. The place was still getting set up back then but in just a couple of months, it has become one of the busiest places! The food is not bad either. I have tried the crepes (Everything Crepes), hot dogs (CaliDog Fusion Dog) and the pizza (Pizza Bocca Lupa) and wasn&#39;t disappointed! My favorite wine bar - Vino Vino also nests in this little square. They have some really good wine on tap and their appetizers are pretty good too.   There is seating indoors as well as outdoors. Its lovely to sit out and enjoy a beer on a sunny afternoon. Love their patio! There is a historic building which is also a part of the complex and you can see if you are sitting out. Being a history junkie, I found it quite fascinating!   The weekends tend to get really busy but there is a parking garage right across the street that is pretty convenient.  
                  I LOVE THIS PLACE!! It is probably one of the coolest/chill spots to get food and hang out with friends. It definitely has something for everyone! There is a huge variety of food, from tacos to thai, burgers, sushi, salad, soup, pizza, hotdogs, the list goes on! There is also a superb selection of beers that I have never heard of, ut the employee helped me pick out the perfect one :)! There is also a great bar and fantasitic wine bar! San Pedro Square Market also offers free wifi AND parking validations for the garage across the street! I definitely recommend this place. It is one of my favorite spots!  
                  I always love SPSM! It&#39;s such a fun environment and lots of great choices for food or drinks.  Tons of outdoor seating, great for daytime drinks in the sun.  They just opened up a new section over by Blush and I can&#39;t wait to try out the food there!  
                  My initial experience with this kind of market was at the Oxbow Market in Napa. I fell in love with the concept, so I was ecstatic to learn that they brought it to downtown San Jose.   San Pedro Square Market has great atmosphere and a wide variety of things to try. You can kick back with some coffee from B2, eat lunch from one of the many establishments here and do some people watching while you&#39;re at it, or finish off your meal with some dessert at Treatbot or Cre-Paris. In the mood for some alcohol? They&#39;ve got the bars! Heck, they even have a barber shop for all your manly hair needs. Also saw live music and dancing one Saturday, so that was pretty cool.  Parking is easy, which is a MAJOR plus, especially in downtown. There&#39;s a garage next door with validation available inside the market and there&#39;s also metered parking right next to the market.  San Pedro Square Market alone has made downtown a more attractive place to hang out for me, because I usually don&#39;t hang out downtown. Seems like they have a few leasing spaces left, so there are probably going to be even more cool places setting up here. Can&#39;t wait to see what they are!  SPSM easily gets 5 stars from me. :)  
                  Great place to hangout in downtown SJ..  
                  San Pedro market is a great place. I&#39;m not from San Jose, so I didn&#39;t know about this place till a friend invited me to come down for a bday celebration. Glad I came!  San Pedro market reminds me a lot of Oxbow market in Napa. Lots of little restaurants all in one building. I love the outdoor seating area at San Pedro market. Hear lamps to keep you warm at night, music playing to keep the night moving, and a pretty good crowd of people.  It&#39;s definitely a great spot to hangout at. Lots of choices for food, like wood fire pizza, tacos, sushi, noodles just to name some. If I&#39;m ever back in the San Jose area,  for sure I will be coming back again.  
                  San Pedro Square Market is a random collection of different food cuisines and other small business.  It reminds me a lot of a &#34;food court&#34;.  Glad to have this collection of places to eat so close to work.  It also makes grabbing lunch with coworkers pretty easy since there are a ton of options to make everyone happy.  Although there are a lot of office buildings in the area, I would exercise caution in coming here at night -make sure to come with friends or follow closely behind a group of people - safety in numbers.  
                  I&#39;m almost embarrassed to admit that I&#39;ve lived in the bay area for umpteen years and I had never been to San Pedro Square until this past weekend. Wow.  Unbelievable.  I don&#39;t know how, being a foodie, I missed this stand alone food court.  We had a friend in town from out of state and we all went down to see what they had.  We had a few options inside. Pizza, sushi, Mexican etc.  Our friend had the pizza which looked decent.  She said she liked it.  The thin crust looked good, slightly charred as it should be. Next time I&#39;ll try the pizza.  We tried the sushi place...BLUSH.  We had a spicy tuna roll which was decent, and we tried the Hawaiian Poke Salad which was a bit slimy.  Raw fish should NEVER be slimy.  I also tried a cocktail that was like a slushie.  They have all different kinds of varieties.  I had a sour lemon one and I liked it.  Afterwards we had a ice cream cookie sandwich from the gourmet food truck set up inside. Very good.  They need to add peanut butter cookies to their choice of cookies!  Say what you want about the food, but this place has an awesome, relaxed vibe.  Plenty of outdoor seating.  it&#39;s a great place to just go and hang out with family and friends.    I&#39;m going back to try some of the other food booths.  I heard the Pho booth had some good food.  
                  I love San Pedro Square Market! There are so many food/beverage options available its hard to choose which one I like more! Came here yesterday and ordered a couple of drinks and then sat on the patio outside for a while. On a few different occasions they have had live music outside as well. Lots of seating and heat lamps. Plus, a whole other building right behind the main one with more food and beverage and BEER options. Great place to hang out any night of the week.  
                  Love this place, come here every time I visit the greatest city in the world, San Jose. Lively with lots of choices.  What&#39;s with the synchronized whining about no bikes? Who cares? You all should get a hold of yourselves.   Buy a decent lock and park it outside.  
                  LOVE, LOVE , LOVE this place!!! Why, oh why wasn&#39;t it here when i lived so much closer????  Since we were in SJ on a Saturday evening, we decided to head here for dinner and drinks.  I appreciated that the parking is free with validation (at the bar.) I was totally impressed with the variety of high quality (yet reasonably priced) food offered. I also really liked that the bar has servers come around and take orders and bring drinks out.   This is a jewel of a spot, a great concept being done so well. There&#39;s nothing like it on the Peninsula. Unfortunately:(  If i lived closer, I&#39;d be here all the time. The patio looked like it would be fun to hang out on during the warmer months.  I was impressed by how fast the tables were cleared and cleaned off, and how friendly and nice every staff member was.  I usually can&#39;t find anything worth coming to SJ for.Until now, I will definitely be back.  
                  Upscale food court of sorts. Loved the variety of restaurants. Spent Saturday afternoon there with hubby and my toddler. Surprisingly there were several people with strollers. We had the calidogs (pretty tasty), the tacos (again pretty good) duck fat fries (good), beer (great variety), cup cakes( average, not that great) and some coffee ( even though they used the best ingredients, the coffee was not to my taste. I like the dark roasts and their variety was pretty mild. I ended up drinking only a couple of sips). Overall loved the ambience and had a great time. Will definitely go back!  
                  Great place to be regardless if you are a SJSU student, business person, or have a family. This place has everything for everyone!  
                  Came here tonight for the first time with a group of buddies for dinner.  It was a Saturday night (3/30/2013) and the San Jose Sharks had a game so there were noticeable San Jose Sharks fan showing off their team pride by donning the SJ Sharks apparel.   From what I understand, there are two buildings that forms the SAN PEDRO SQUARE MARKET.  On one side you got sandwiches, hot dogs, pizza, Mediterranean, mexican..etc.  Let&#39;s call this SIDE A.  On the other side, you got your desserts like ice cream, cookie, cupcakes..etc. Let&#39;s call this SIDE B.  My review is based only from my experience tonight.  SIDE A: Very very noisy.  You got a band playing really loud music.  Lots of people talking.  Minimal available seating.  Bad lighting.  Many times you have to come really close to someone before you can understand what they are saying (that loud).    SIDE B: Much more quiet.  There were still people talking, but not as much noise as the other building.  The lighting over here was much brighter.  Things felt more spread out and not as cramp as the other side.  My buddies and I stayed in SIDE A for about an hour and then moved over to SIDE B for the remainder of the night.  Overall, I can see how SAN PEDRO SQUARE MARKET place can be a popular place for people to hang out, drink, and socialize.  (While waiting for my pizza to be ready, a female bartender approached my buddy and I asking if we wanted to order anything from the bar.)  But from my experience tonight, I thought the place was okay.  
                  Awesome for variety of food and atmosphere but the crowds can get a bit much. Coming late afternoon on a Saturday is better for table access (at least for today when there&#39;s no special events, ie live music, etc.). Still making my way through the various eateries. So far fans of Pizza Bocca Lupo, Calidog (for the kid), Taco Bar and On a Roll in main building. Like Blush, Treatbot &amp; Chocatoo in the other building.  Will update as I try more.  Tip: garage validation machine at the Market Bar  
                  I absolutely love this place! This has been the go to place  for our book club and work outings. The diversity of food is amazing. My two favorites are the Pizza place Buca something, sorry can&#39;t remember name and Treatbot Truck. Treatbot also does Karaoke ^.^  Just watch out for Sharks games, It can get pretty full in there.  
                  Day or night, San Pedro Square is the perfect place for food and drinks. Go with a group of friends/coworkers, a date, or even by yourself.   For food: Pizza Bocca Lupo - Delicious, authentic pizza! Actually comes close to the ones I&#39;ve had in Italy. Konjoe Burger bar - Pork belly burger is good. Just a tad oily though. On a Roll - Try the BBQ pork sandwich. Yes, it is more expensive than the average hole in the wall Vietnamese sandwich. But you&#39;re paying extra for the San Pedro square ambience. Phonomenal - Shaking beef w/ tomato rice is really flavorful. But the portion is pretty small for the price. Bray Butcher Block and Bistro - I haven&#39;t personally tried it yet. But I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s very filling and amazing!  For dessert: CreParis - I love getting the smores crepe because there aren&#39;t many crepe places that have it. I usually substitute the chocolate with nutella. Chocatoo - The cookies here are always warm and fresh.  Not a fan of: Robee&#39;s Falafel - I had the chicken shawarma and it was pretty dry. There&#39;s a lot of better Mediterranean places downtown.  Blush - Just come here for drinks, not food. Food isn&#39;t worth it if you&#39;re not ordering during happy hour. You&#39;re better off just getting their strong blush drinks. Treatbot - I don&#39;t really get the hype. The ice cream is good, but nothing out of the ordinary.  Tips: - They do validate parking at the garage across the street. But don&#39;t come here if there&#39;s a concert/event/Shark&#39;s game at the SAP center because the garage will charge for parking then. Unless you don&#39;t mind paying of course. - For drinks, check out the happy hour at the Market Bar. I&#39;ve gotten a huge 25oz hefeweizen beer for $5 on a Wednesday night.  - There are a lot of professionals who come here after work on weekdays. So it&#39;s also a really a great place to network!  
                  San Pedro Square is jam packed with silly cone valley misfits, This place is swimming with geeks, freaks and nerds. I never have seen so many varieties of jeans, t-shirts and scruffy facial hair with the occasional de-riguer backwards A&#39;s cap. This is where the start-up programmers come to deprogram and unwind after a 48 hour stay-at-the-office-sleeping -under-the -desk marathon. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I like this place, it is like the Google cafeteria but with lots of booze. If it were an HBO show it would be Silicon Valley not Entourage: no beautiful people here.  
                  San Pedro Square Market. All I can say is that... why was this place not there while I was in high school? This place has a foodie atmosphere which I&#39;m all about, though a bit on the side of hipstery and a bit expensive. However, what we had tried was reat and I cannot wait to go back to try more.   Pizza Bocca Lupa: As anyone would tell I am all about cheese and the mozerella CHEESE that made our pizza so wonderful. Thin crust and very quick to serve. We had it with an excellent side of bread complete with marinara dipping sauce. Delicious and love love it.  Taco Bar: These tacos were definitely yummy but on the SPICY side so beware for the extra kick. Loved that they were on corn tortillas (no I do not do flour tortillas.. sorry). It was a bit pricey for the food that you get however, I wouldn&#39;t mind trying it again.   This is a great place to come by with friends and chill with whatever tastes your party is feeling for. You will definitely see me back!  
                  I looooove this place so much! I&#39;ve been going here 3 times in a row this week and I can&#39;t get enough of it lol bout to watch the Warriors btw! Woohooo!  
                  What an awesome place to relax. The market offers a large variety of enjoyments you can enjoy with friends. Say watch a game, drinking some exotic beer, have dessert, then some well made street food.  
                  I love this place.  
                  I&#39;ve been to San Pedro Square Market about 3 times, they have eateries and bars. Blush Bar is always a great place to start, it&#39;s intimate. There&#39;s also The Old Wagon which is also so much fun if you have a big group and like to drink. Prices are fair &amp; the drinks are strong! :-)  
                  San Pedro Square Market is a GEM in San Jose. It has a Ferry Building feel to it, and the eateries are just getting better and better. I&#39;m not are how the schedule works, but there is live music in the outdoor seating area. Check this place out!  
                  Great place to start a night out.. prime location to other cool places downtown. Usually suggest friends to meet up here,  everyone can have a different cuisine and still eat together. Very classy but not at all pretentious and feels like you are miles away from the &#39;less desired,  areas of downtown.  
                  One of my favorite go-to spots in San Jose.  So many different places to eat - if you bring a bunch of folks everyone can choose something different.  I&#39;ve been to most of the places in there for lunch, and the lights are so pretty at night.  
                  Such a cute place to sit and chill. So didn&#39;t expect it in San Jose being from Socal but this place made my weekend trip :).   When you first walk in, it&#39;s a huge marketplace that sells food but then you walk in deeper and you&#39;ll hit a bar, walk through the tables and you&#39;ll see another bar that plays good music, then another area where they serve bottles of beer. Pricing is decent.   Definitely would recommend this place to people and definitely would come back.  
                  I love this place so kuch! Great food and great beer selection!  This is the first time iv been here with the sun out and it&#39;s just as much fun! This place is great for any occasion.  
                  What a cool thing they&#39;ve done to the market! I love all the open seating (indoor and outdoor). Reminds me a lot of what you would see in San Francisco on the pier. Lots of places to grab a bite to eat, snack, a cocktail, a beer. I can&#39;t wait to explore this place some more.  So far I&#39;ve visited: Blush Raw Bar and Lounge Garage Bar Market Beer Co  
                  I&#39;ve always been very scared to go to very crowded places because I just don&#39;t like being looked at. But recently, I&#39;ve come here so much and met so many friendly people, that my anxiety have somehow slowly gone away.   Everyone I&#39;ve met so far all have some kind of interesting story to tell and then somehow midway conversation, I&#39;m talking about my tattoos! It&#39;s always being brought up. Makes me happy that I have some amazing work done and there&#39;s a story behind each tattoo! :)   You can bring your dog here and I think that&#39;s pretty cool. I&#39;ll probably bring one of my dogs here the next time I come back. He can meet all the other fur children who are here over the weekends.  Plent of great restaurants/counter and bars to have a seat at. I haven&#39;t yet tried everything here but I&#39;m working on it!  Weekends are more fun!  
                  I live in downtown San Jose. I have been a resident of San Jose for about 18 years now. I have seen this city transform and it&#39;s nice to see how much downtown San Jose changed.  What used to be San Pedro Square Market back in 2004-2006, was a club called Deep. It was my old stomping grounds in my early 20s. I used to love that club because I didn&#39;t have to dress up. I rolled in wearing chucks and jeans. It was a common Club Deep Thursday uniform.   However, things have changed. Downtown San Jose went from dangerous, grimy, and transient hang out (still is ... since I had a transient try to get into my house and give me a lotto ticket) to a place where there are multiple new homes that houses young professionals, lots of small business, and a more diversified set of people.   There were a lot of politics involved into building San Pedro Market. Mostly, club owners argued that the city and influential developers were discriminating against the clubs to build this modern day food court. Honestly, I am glad they did. I don&#39;t miss the clubs that have come and gone, it tend to attract a not so &#34;professional&#34; crowd. Also I am way past those clubbing days anyway.  The one big thing that I like about SPSM is that it&#39;s not the usual San Jose strip mall that houses chain restaurant. San Joseans love those, however I do not. No judgments to those who do. However, this market actually houses a lot of local small business owners. To my surprise, one of them being an old high school friend. I rather put money into my fellow neighbors&#39; pocket than some big conglomerate, and I encourage others to do the same.   I love the design theory (an upscale open market/food court) and more so that it is sustaining and building San Jose&#39;s economy. Now, we have a unique market which caters to the influx of new and diverse DTSJ residents with a desire for something &#34;different&#34;.   Another big plus, it is also super close to my house that we can take the taxi and not worry about having a DD  
                  This was actually a really chill square. There&#39;s a bar, barber shop, food choices, and lots of seating. Good place for groups, and they have both inside and outside seating. They have booths and a couple long tables inside. This is definitely a nice place to hang out with friends and grab a drink if you want to avoid the bars.  If I lived in the SJ area, I would probably come back often to enjoy the area.  They also validate parking btw (not sure if it&#39;s only on the weekends or if it&#39;s all week). If not, meters are $1/hour.  THE METERS ARE TRICKY THOUGH. I parked in a spot and saw the guy in front of me leaving. I then checked his meter after he left and it had 14 minutes left, so, being the un-wasteful person I am, drove forward to claim his 14 minutes as my own. HOWEVER, when I then went to check his meter, it read 0! Super tricky meters. I guess they&#39;re &#34;smart&#34; and remove their leftover time when you drive away. Tricky, very tricky.  
                  Great selection of food and drinks. Awesome place to hang out with friends. I used to go a lot when I worked downtown last year. Love the burger place in the back and the Mexican place makes awesome vegetarian quesadillas. Good for any night of the week.  
                  Trying to find a place to accommodate our vegetarian co-worker is difficult among a bunch of meat-lovers. Luckily, she suggested this place and it worked out perfectly.  This place is pretty much like an upscale food court. Plenty of choices to choose from  which kicked my indecisiveness up a notch, and of course I was the last one to order. Sushi, sandwiches, drinks, dessert, burgers... pretty much got them all at this place. There is plenty of seating and even has nice outdoor seating. Perfect for summer dinners with a group!  Overall, I think this is a good place to go with a group and you can&#39;t decide what to eat. Prices can be little up there, but the choices of food and atmosphere help makes up for it.  
                  This place is a haven for the undecided!  There are so many different options for food here and it&#39;s all pretty good.    I love the Little Chef Counter, they have an ever changing menu of delicious food.  Robee&#39;s Falafel has huge chicken wraps and are oh so tasty hot.   On a Roll has a pretty good chicken noodle dish (chicken has a hint of lemongrass).  And for dessert....Treatbot!  Really unusual ice cream flavors, sometimes I end up sampling them all until I settle on the perfect one....for the day.  Or CreParis!  I want to come back and try Pizza Bocca Lupa, Blush, and the Little Cheese Shoppe (artisan grilled cheese, hellooooo).  It&#39;s great to have such a plethora of great food at your fingertips.  The outdoor patio is also a great place to hang out on a nice day.  Lots of people watching.  Parking was fairly manageable.  This place is going to be unbelievable when it&#39;s finished...what a gem to find.  
                  Nice place for a hang out with friend to have some drinks. During the afternoons is very family oriented. Tons of kids running around. But at night it gets better. The restaurants around are very nice, you can find from asian food to Mexican food. There are good amount of seats so will always find somewhere to chill. Parking is very convenient during weekends since you can validate your pass for the rest of the night. And parking spaces are very generous.  
                  This place is awesome! I just wish they had opened earlier when I was actually working in downtown San Jose. All the little stands and shops are a great alternative to the dichotomy of low brow taqueria or fine dining that is typical of the area. It used to be that the only quick service place I could go was Sonoma Chicken Coop, but I feel that their quality has dwindled in the last few years (and now you have to ASK for pizza bread!). So SPSM is a great alternative for hanging out with friends, grabbing a quick bite to eat, kicking back with a brew, and enjoying the good California weather!  I was especially impressed with their use of renewable and recycled building materials. It has a lovely industrial look to it that blends well with the surroundings. But there are also thoughtful touches that integrate San Jose&#39;s Spanish mission past. I also love that there is so much public shared seating and outdoor space. Parking across the street in the structure is a breeze, and if you&#39;re lucky you can even snag a spot on the street at 6pm when the street parking becomes free first come-first serve.  I&#39;ll be back to enjoy the new offerings as there are still plenty of retailers that are moving in. SPSM is an absolutely fabulous and much needed addition to downtown SJ!  
                  The Market is  one of those times when a well thought-out plan works for all concerned.  The outside is a mixture of old and new, rustic and contemporary architecture all blending together to form a center for good eats, conversation, and, who knows, maybe a writer in the corner placing a few last words on that final chapter.  The Market is   an atmosphere  The Market is   a gathering place  The Market is   an inspiration  The Market is   diversity  The Market is   a compilation of culinary performers  
                  I&#39;ve been here twice and both times were great. However, I only had drinks at the back bar and pizza.  I was sorta weary when my boyfriend took me inside, essentially, a food court, to get a drink. However, this place is AWESOME! The food is by no means &#34;food court&#34; type. Although I have only tried the places I mentioned the variety of food is vast and by the constant crowds, I assume delicious as well.  Expect to wait at the back bar, especially after a  Sharks game, but its not too long. In my opinon the male bartenders make better drinks. Try the Sazerac, if you dare. The bf says its one of the best he&#39;s ever had.  
                  Nice market with many options for food and inside and outside seating area.  Since there is a construction right next to them, unfortunately it was rather loud.  I&#39;m sure once they are done building that high-rise building it will be a bit quieter noise wise.  On Tuesday around noon, the market was pretty busy.  
                  Great place, makes me proud to live in San Jose - have brought sooo many people from out of town here - truly a jewel!
