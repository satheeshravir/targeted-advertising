                  I was a big fan of Little Chef Counter, the predecessor to this place. I see a lot of the reviews mentioned the high prices at Lou&#39;s. There is a connection, The San Pedro Market has some greedy owners that charge really high rent for this awesome location and from time to time you see places go under because of that. That being said you also get quality food for your money as there is a lot of really good competition. Lou&#39;s seems to have what it takes to make it here. The portions are huge compared to other vendors in the market and the food is tasty and served fresh.     I am a fan of the po-boy sandwich, It&#39;s Spicy Silva Pork Sausage (Andouille), shrimp, lettuce, tomato &amp; their special sauce on a bun with slaw. It&#39;s served with a mound of perfectly seasoned and crispy french fries. The bread was fresh and toasted on the inside so you could still fit this monster in your mouth without tearing it up. A real treat.     My buddies always get the fish sandwiches and they love them, thats on my list...     I&#39;ll be back!  
                  We got the Andouille + shrimp po&#39; boy and an order of fish and chips. Unlike every other fish and chips I&#39;ve ever been to, they wouldn&#39;t let me order standalone fried fish. But well, the fries were pretty good so no actual complaints about that I guess...  The po&#39; boy had a good balance of flavors and textures, but only like 4 small shrimp in it which felt like a ripoff. The fish and chips was a generous portion of 3 large pieces of fish, and though quite edible, I&#39;m annoyed that I took a bite into some raw batter on the fish. The tartar sauce could also use some work, it&#39;s much too sweet.  Might come back if I&#39;m not feeling anything else in San Pedro Square, but what are the chances of that?  
                  GET THE CATFISH SANDWICH AND ADD BACON!!!!!  FOOD: See above. The portions are HUGE and the flavors are insane. I love this sandwich. Great for a pre or post drink session on a night out.   SERVICE: Speedy, kind, and on point. What more could you ask for on a busy night when you&#39;re out with friends?   I will return a million times over just to eat this sandwich.  
                  There used to be another restaurant here only a few months ago, but it got replaced by Lou&#39;s and all for the better!   I love seafood and this place delivers. However, I had to create a sandwich from my mind. They offer two shrimp sandwich&#39;s, but both don&#39;t have fried shrimp! You need fried shrimp in your shrimp sandwiches. So, I asked them if they could make it using their popcorn shrimp, and they did it! Guess what? They did it well and it was fantastic.   After the tragedy of City Bistro closing down (RIP) I have been looking for a shrimp sandwich that could replace it. This one doesn&#39;t even come close, but it might be the closest I&#39;ve found. It was damn good.   Service was friendly and they did what I asked and did it well. Big thumbs up.  
                  Love this spot! I tried it for the first time on Thursday. Not only is the service awesome and friendly, the food is delicious!   I ordered the fried calamari and the Po&#39; boy sandwich with shrimp and andouille.   The fried calamari was light and airy and served with cocktail and tartar sauce. They give you the body and the tentacles which I love. The Po&#39; boy was super delicious too! Served on a toasted roll with slaw and their sauce...so good.   It was a lot for me to eat at lunch time, but I was so hungry I didn&#39;t have a problem doing it at all! I will be back for sure. It&#39;s a great addition to SPMS. I&#39;m glad there&#39;s a seafood spot close to me now!  
                  The shack that replaced The Little Chef&#39;s Counter. I won&#39;t compare and contrast just rate it on a clean slate.  Ambiance Parking: Street parking or parking structure. If you buy something I believe over $10 your parking is validate!  Seating:  * 5 seats right up front and the rest are all 4th street parking.  Feels:  * Definitely something different in the Market. Family friends for younins and elderly. Since it&#39;s in the market, it inherits the ambiance of sports fanatics, schools partakin in adobe brick tours, and entrepreneurs hustling away.  Food: Fish and Chips (Recommend) Solid. The chips were flavorful and the chips were large crunchy and delightful. For a more safe choice. This would be the bite for you.  Spicy Catfish Sandwich (Recommend) This sandwich definitely delivers. Served fresh with a quite favorable kick. For those craving something different out of your ordinary fish sandwich. This is a great way to go.  Po-Boy (Recommend) A combination of shrimps and sausage with general sandwich fundamentals (tomatoes, lettuce and strong mustard).  Tuna Melt (A-Ok) For a safe bet, it&#39;s a good way to go. Cheese and seasoned tuna.  Customer Service: My cashier brought his energy which was pretty cool. Service took a reasonable 10 minutes.  Overall: 4 stars. A different taste that contributes to the wholeness of the market. Price was reasonable, food was good, and service was great. Not an absolute must but I do appreciate this place.  TL;DR Tips: * They valet parking. $10 minimum  
                  I was disappointed to learn that Little Chef Counter had closed.  Their poutine was not that great but hey, they had it!  So, I was a bit apprehensive to try Lou&#39;s.  I ordered their Andouille sausage/shrimp po boy and side order of fries.    The po boy was ok.  The bread is definitely not a po boy style bread though.  It was more of a bread for gourmet sausages.  The sausage/shrimp combo provided a good contrast in flavor.  However, the sausage didn&#39;t really have that andouille flavor or spice.  So what made it a po boy?  Their spicy remoulade was delicious.  It wasn&#39;t overly spicy but you could feel the subtle heat.  Their &#34;generic&#34; fries were anything but, however.  The spices and cheese they added were a great addition.  I highly recommend them!  Note that they do not serve any soda so you&#39;ll have to get it at another establishment.  I&#39;m looking forward to trying their Fish n Chips!  
                  Decided to eat at San Pedro Market because so many restaurants in downtown had a 1-2 hour wait due to the SJSU graduations. I&#39;m very familiar with San Pedro Market and noticed that Lou&#39;s Beach Shack is one of the newer spots.   My friends and I decided to give this place a try. All of us ordered the Fish and Chips, something pretty basic. The service was quick and the food came out in about 5 minutes.   I thought the food was okay. The fries and fish had a nice crunch. The food was served with a side of cocktail sauce, tarter sauce and a lemon wedge. I didn&#39;t feel that the food was amazing, making me want to come back for more. However, I do want to come back to try the smoked salmon sandwich. I love salmon and probably should&#39;ve ordered it the first time. Oh well.   The place is worth a try!  
                  Not entirely sure where I stand on Lou&#39;s Beach Shack.  On one hand, it promises -- and delivers -- on hot, crispy, tasty seafood.  One the other hand, so does City Fish just a few blocks away, except it&#39;s $3 less and gives way bigger portion. And back on the other hand, Lou&#39;s Beach Shack is much, much more convenient to get to.  And they have burgers!  Anyway, in terms of quality, Lou&#39;s Beach Shack is pretty good!  I liked their calamari, which was nicely breaded and fried, and their fish and chips, which were served with deliciously seasoned fries (Old Bay?)  The main gripe I have with them is *portion* control.  In a move that I can only deem &#34;deceptive,&#34; they put all the sauces on the bottom and all the fries on top, leaving you with the illusion that the basket is filled with fries, when in fact it&#39;s filled with plastic containers of tartar sauce (woo), and cocktail sauce (which I will never use, so... less woo).  Their fish and chips is a decently sized portion for a dieter, or if you had a hearty breakfast, but their calamari was honestly, in my opinion, a half portion.  Sadness.  I&#39;m not going to say no to more seafood options in San Pedro Square, but overall not the greatest bang for your buck, even at San Pedro Square.  I&#39;ll be back when I&#39;m craving.  ---  sweet: food delivered hot and tasty bitter: price and portion are sadness.  
                  My sister being a seafood fan came here to grab a sandwich while I got us a ginormous potato at SPUDS to share. She got the Lou&#39;s beach shack - Po&#39; Boy Sandwich which was pretty good. The pork sausage and shrimp were really good and I liked how you can taste the grilled flavor. Everything else (bread, lettuce tomato, sauce) was okay.   Overall, it was a pretty good sandwich, but I was only a fan of some parts of it.  
                  The staff seems grumpy. It would be nice if they liked their job and didn&#39;t just grunt. Other than that, the food is good.  
                  It&#39;s too bad Lou&#39;s in Willow Glen didnt stick around after a return. However it&#39;s got a mini comeback in the San Pedro market. The grilled Tilapia Fish sandwich and popcorn shrimp are solid. There are a handfulmof other choices i p,an on trying but it&#39;s a far cry from the large menu at their old flagship. Hopefully it rotates through those said selections which will make it worth coming back to over and over  
                  Came here during lunch on a weekday. There was probably a total of 4 entree choices and I decided to go with a shrimp roll which came with a side of slaw. The wait seemed pretty quick. Five minutes maybe?  The portion was pretty small. The shrimp roll came in a square-ish hot dog bun and was stuffed with a cold shrimp mix similar to a shrimp ceviche, but sweeter. It was delicious but the toasty warm bun became cold and soggy in seconds and was very messy to eat.   Overall, the food was good but given how small it was, the shrimp roll was definitely not worth $10.95 + tax.  
                  This place opened on Tuesday, August 11, 2015. And it&#39;s already the talk of the town. In my opinion, it&#39;s now the best food in San Pedro Square.   I had the basic fish sandwich. It&#39;s grilled so it&#39;s healthy. The lettuce, tomato, and onions were super crisp and fresh. The coleslaw was very tasty--not bland or dry like other places. And the clam chowder! I thought I was in Maine. So authentically good.   It&#39;s a rarity to find so many items this good. Usually you would expect something to be just average. But here everything was a 10--seriously. That was my experience.   I got here during their first hour. The people are so nice and the food is amazing. It&#39;s the Beach Shack! Lots of fun.  
                  Pretty good but WAY overpriced!  I work near the San Pedro Market so I&#39;ve been to every restaurant many times and while overall, prices are higher, you can get a pretty good value at most places, here, no so much. I ordered the Cajun popcorn shrimp $9.95 for that price it does not include fries or any other side! Also ordered a lemonade, 16oz and kind of watered down for $2.95. My meal arrived and I had what amounted to probably 1 cup of shrimp! They were a little soggy due to the seasoning but tasted great and the shrimp itself was obviously very fresh. Had a side been included, the price would have been closer to reasonable but as for now, I wasn&#39;t overly impressed.  
                  Gave this place a try recently, it was ok.  I ordered the po boy which was filled with a sausage and shrimp.  Unfortunately only 3 quarter sized shrimp.  The po boy was decent, but could&#39;ve used a better sauce.  It tasted like it just had mustard in it.  The po boy also came with a nice heaping side of fries which were fresh out of the fryer.  Overall not a bad addition to San Pedro Square, but not the best restaurant in there either.  My biggest disappointment was that it seemed like a place that would sell Maine Lobster Rolls, but they don&#39;t offer that here...  
                  I love seafood and this is my go to place in the square... The chowder is really good and their poboy&#39;s are really delicious....  The cajun fries that come most orders... like... awesome.  Fried artichoke hearts ... need I say more?  Live a little and enjoy life with this good food.  
                  I really like this place.  A lot of is fried stuff but it is never over done.    The people that work here are so friendly.!    My family and I will eat at their new little spot and we use Caviar for them.   Completely recommend this place.  
                  Came here last Sunday and wanted to try out this new place. I love seafood, so I thought this would be perfect. I got the popcorn shrimp and wasn&#39;t disappointed. It came in an orange sauce, which was very yummy! After I finished that, I went back to get a SNOW CONE! How awesome is that! The person working the machine might not have had that much experience with the machine though because my snow cone was kind of all over the place, it didn&#39;t bother me, I just thought it was funny. :)   Can&#39;t wait to try them again!  
                  Best grilled shrimp sandwich ever! I every bite was so delicious, and I can&#39;t wait to come back!  
                  I used to go to Lou&#39;s Village and I was eager to try the latest incarnation of San Jose&#39;s great seafood restaurant. It did not disappoint.   I was in a party of three. I had the grilled cheese sandwich, which is a dish that is typically predicable. Luckily, this one was not one of those typical grilled cheeses. The sandwich was delicious. The cheese was not your run-of-the-mill Kraft singles, and the addition of tomato was great idea that I think I&#39;ll start doing in my own kitchen.   Another member of my party had the popcorn shrimp. I managed to steal a couple off her plate and they were just as good as my grilled cheese sandwich. The spicy sauce that came with them was equally delicious.  I am saving the best for last. The third member of my party had the fish and chips. I had a bite of the fish and can safely say it was some of the best battered fish I have had this side of Britain. The meat was flaky and not overdone. The batter was exactly how it should be, not overly breaded and not too thin. I will be ordering this the next time I come here.  The staff was very friendly and the food came out in a timely fashion. I am really looking forward to coming back to this establishment at San Pedro Square. San Pedro is already a great place for food and drinks and this restaurant only adds to the appeal of the whole place. 5 stars!  
                  I get takeout from here on Fridays, and have worked my through the menu. The fish and chips are always excellent, with three nice pieces of fish to an order. The calamari is delicious. My favorite is the tuna melt, which is packed with tuna--not tuna salad. Also try the po&#39; boy--different versions come and go, but I&#39;ve never had one yet that wasn&#39;t yummy. The counter team is super friendly, and they pack the food to go extremely well (which many places can&#39;t figure out). Highly recommend.  
                  I had the fish and chips and my wife had the pear salad with shrimp. Both items were very tasty indeed. Will return to try the Po&#39;Boy next.  
                  What a find! Ordered the babes beach burger, shrimp roll and calamari. The burger is honestly one of the best I&#39;ve ever had cooked in front of you on a diner style flat top served with garlic fries.  The shrimp roll was flavorful and very generously served between 2 butter toasted rolls. Calamari was crispy and delicious.  Will be returning very soon and highly recommend the friendly staff.  
                  Finally a pure seafood restaurant in the market.  I had fish and chips,  and although a little pricey I was very satisfied.  The fish was crispy and tasty and chips were cooked to perfection.  I will be returning for more.  
                  As a lover of the Lou&#39;s Village back in the day, I am so happy that they offer some of the classics in a less formal environment.  Daryle is a sweetheart and makes us always feel at home when we go.  The fried artichokes are amazing, and their burger was very good and a great value.  To end the visit, we get the Pina Colada cotton candy, or whatever flavor they recommend that day.  
                  Fried calamari and popcorn shrimp were very nice. Slightly over price but I loved it. I wouldn&#39;t recommend clam chowder though. I&#39;d rather have other menus ;)  
                  I went to Lou&#39;s Shack tonight and had the shrimp sandwich with fries.  The taste was great and there was plenty of shrimp.  Roman waited on me and the customer service was great.  He even brought me my food.  I settled into the open area and got the last few minutes of the 49er game on this rainy afternoon.  I will be back and try some more dishes.  
                  Welcome back Lou&#39;s!  Devotees of Lou&#39;s Village (first opened in 1946) will welcome this tiny reincarnation at San Jose&#39;s San Pedro Square Market.  Today was the &#34;soft-opening&#34; and the food was fresh and delicious, and the service was fast.   Note:  This is a small walk-up stand (just seven counter stools) and the menu is minimal, but oh-so-good.  If you&#39;re craving the Famous Lou&#39;s clam chowder or calamari, this is the only place.  San Pedro Square Market has ample indoor and outdoor seating, so if the counter stools are full, no problem.  Check out Lou&#39;s Po&#39; Boy sandwich and the Castroville fried artichoke hearts too; both are excellent.  
                  The fish sandwich is excellent, and the price is very reasonable. I appreciate the small menu to keep everything fresh!  
                  Basic fish sandwich with grilled tilapia was delicious and flavorful. It comes with a side of cole slaw. The menu is small and doesn&#39;t have too many options. I may try the organic cotton candy next time  
                  Came here for a quick lunch on a weekday and honestly can&#39;t say I was very impressed. I ordered the fish sandwich which came out quickly and also had a small side of coleslaw. The fish itself was actually fantastic. Nicely seasoned and grilled. But the piece of fish was tiny. There was so much lettuce on the sandwich you could barely see the fish. Plus the wet lettuce caused the bottom bun to become completely soggy and a mess to eat. The coleslaw wasn&#39;t anything special either. Honestly tasted bland and I ended throwing most of it away.  I think the price I paid for the sandwich was defintely not worth it. The other options seemed interesting so I may give this place another shot  
                  I tried the deep fried artichokes at Lou&#39;s Beach Shack today.  So yummy!  Very friendly staff! Food came out fast!  I will definitely be back...
