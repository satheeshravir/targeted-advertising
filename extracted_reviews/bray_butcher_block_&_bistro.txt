                  Bray is dope. They got that all-american vibe type meal that pairs perfectly with any beer from the market bar. The coleslaw is so so good! I grew up absolutely hating coleslaw thanks to KFC, but this coleslaw turned me into a believer. It is truly one of it&#39;s kind. Super vibrant mix of purple and green cabbage with the orange carrots, oh and the blue cheese? ace! Prolly why I love the pork sliders so much. The mac&#39;n&#39;cheese is also a staple. Can&#39;t quite put my finger on what&#39;s in it, but it&#39;s so so good. It appears small in size, but it&#39;s true as a side portion and will leave you wanting more.  The cashier is always pretty helpful about the proportions of items on the menu. My eyes are bigger than my stomach :P  
                  A few buddies and I were looking for some quality, &#34;fall off the bone&#34; ribs to eat in San Jose and tried this place out based on the pictures we saw on Yelp.  It did not disappoint.  Even though the ribs did not appear to be smoked in big ol Texas style offset smokers outside, the ribs still had decent amount of smoke and were super &#34;fall off the bone&#34; tender.  What made it even more amazing was the fruity, sweet, and tart Strawberry BBQ sauce that was slathered on top of the ribs.  It&#39;s probably one of the most unique tasting BBQ sauces I&#39;ve tried and I absolutely love it.    I also tried the big ass pastrami sandwich.  The warm, chewy texture in the rye bread is fantastic and the thinly sliced pastrami was perfectly seasoned. It&#39;s a great sandwich.  
                  Out of all the places I could have gone, I chose Bray. Seriously, this is an economist&#39;s wet dream, perfect competition in action.   Overall, I wasn&#39;t disappointed. Knowing I probably wouldn&#39;t come back anytime soon, I went for variety. I got two different sliders, the BBQ chicken and the pork. Honestly, after all the BBQ sauce, it was hard to tell the difference. But they came on a very bready bun, were as messy as you&#39;d expect and got the job done.   I also ordered the Mac n Cheese. It was a small cup, so good as a side. For me, Mac n Cheese is like an art film, you always come in with high expectations but are too often disappointed. Here, it came through. It was cheesy without being unbearable, and the flavor was spot on. Light and delicious.  
                  Easily one of the best eateries at the San Pedro Market. I keep going back for the tri-tip and the French dip sandwich. Love the side dishes too. The deep fried polenta is amazing. One of these days I will order that all by itself.  Skip the long lines next door and choose wisely with some smoked or grilled meats. It&#39;s what&#39;s for dinner.  
                  I&#39;ve given this place a few more tries since my last review and I guess I caught them on a bad day last time.  I&#39;ve been ordering The Rueben with either corned beef or the pastrami and it has been delicious!  Sometimes the sauerkraut can get overwhelming but the meat is definitely TOP QUALITY.  My only issue with the sandwich was that it was kinda hard to pick up and the bread got slightly soggy but that&#39;s okay.  Either way, I&#39;m starting to enjoy coming here.  I will definitely be back!  
                  The Tri tip sandwich real good $13.50 but you can slit it was someone the sandwich is full of tri tip with Swiss cheese in a black pepper bun. I&#39;ve tried the tri tip sandwich twice both time I left happy. Bray Butcher block Bistro is located it San Pedro Square in the back there is plenty of seating. Will up date this review when I try more stuff there. Most definitely will be back  
                  Ordered: - tri tip sandwich $13 - a bit dry on the meat and somewhat overdosed on the sauce.  Good BBQ wouldn&#39;t need that much sauce! Huge sandwich though, nicely cut in half. - mac and cheese $5 - super super cheesy and baked into golden brown on top. Could use more seasoning (basic salt and pepper) but overall pretty solid.  Nothing special stood out about this place and honestly, to expect a great BBQ joint in the middle of San Jose is to expect a little too much :/  
                  While this restaurant is small in size, it makes up for it with the large sandwich portions and big smiles upon the employees&#39; faces.  I ordered the Corned Beef Reuben ($9.99) and Baked Mac &amp; Cheese ($3.50), which came with a free side of coleslaw. The Reuben was delicious! Everything from the fluffy bread, to the juicy meat, sauerkraut, and condiments were tasty and of high quality (5 stars). The mac &amp; cheese, while small, was creamy and had a bold taste (4 stars). The coleslaw was nice and tangy, even though it&#39;s rare that I eat coleslaw (4 stars).  Moreover, there&#39;s only two reasons why I lowered the overall rating from 5 to 4 stars: I arrived around 3:30pm on a Thursday, and they were supposed to be open during that time, which they weren&#39;t (Yelp might have the wrong business hours). Since I was excited to try their food, I waited 1.5 hours for them to open. Also, while I know that downtown San Jose can get pricey, the food served at Bray&#39;s is expensive enough to stop me from eating here more than I&#39;d like to. If I could get the same meal for $12 instead of almost $15 (after tax), I would probably come here more often.  
                  Dropped in before the Sharks game. Service was quick. 4 bbq pork sliders for $10. Sliders were juicy and had good flavor. Would come back again!  
                  I MIGHT have given this place 4 stars if the meat wasn&#39;t so dry and overcooked.  I got the Tri-tip sandwich on a hungry, hungry, Saturday night. This comes with a side of cole slaw and is placed on a onioned bun.   When I got my order, the aromas hit my nose and I was super excited to get a taste of this GREAT sounding sandwich. Like I said, the meat was over cooked. I like my steak medium rare, so for this was WELL WELL WELLLLL DONE, which was not good.   There was an overdose of BBQ sauce on the sandwich and it was a bit spicy. I don&#39;t mind it, but I just didn&#39;t expect it.  Unless there&#39;s a change to the cook on the meat, I don&#39;t think I would come back for the tri tip sandwich. Perhaps I&#39;ll try a couple of the other items on the menu...but yeah.....  I mean, on the bright side....the cole slaw was good.  
                  Yelp sucks... But this place does not. Chicken + veggies = yum... And the french dip is stupid good. The end.  
                  Excellent food and service. My go too is the Pear salad and chicken wings. You can pretty much throw a dart at the menu and your going to win. You really can&#39;t judge this place on a number scale. Since none of us normal people are paid food professionals you simply can&#39;t knock the place with your non sense. When I&#39;m in the mood for good food I come here!  
                  Au jus was tasty, very juicy. Biggest surprise was the slaw! Probably the best I ever had. Cilantro adds a nice flavor. Would love to have a sandwich with that inside.  
                  Gotta say that I&#39;m super glad that I found this spot (and decided NOT to go to Konjoe for once) after the massive disappointment that was Smoking Pig BBQ. It&#39;s not a straight BBQ-only spot, but they have some pretty damn good baby back ribs and mac and cheese. Not the best baby back ribs I&#39;ve had, but they were pretty easy to get off the bone, flavored real well, and slathered with a ton of saucy BBQ. Mac and cheese was pretty cheese and had unique flavor to it, but it worked really well.  All I know is that I left very satisfied and super full. Another spot worth coming to at San Pedro Square!  
                  Walked around San Pedro square trying to figure out where to get food and ended up here.  I ordered the pastrami Reuben with a side of Mac n cheese.  The Reuben was delicious - loaded with meat, just enough sauerkraut, and sandwiched between crispy bread.  I asked the girl at the counter if the Mac n cheese was good, and she HIGHLY recommended it.  The Mac n cheese was rich, but combined with the Reuben, the meal was more than enough for me.  I ended up sharing most of my Mac n cheese and a quarter of my sandwich.  I only wished that the Cole slaw that came with the sandwich was bigger, because the slaw really helped break the saltiness of the sandwich.  
                  Came here after working out at my crossfit gym nearby.  I ordered the Reuben and the grilled corn with lime and cotija cheese.  They gave me a pager to let me know when my food was ready to be picked up.  It didn&#39;t take very long.  The sandwich was large and the pastrami was really good.  It was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  They give you a generous portion of meat.  It also came with a bacon and cheese slaw, which was okay, but I&#39;m not a fan of slaws usually.  The corn was awesome!  It had a little bit too much sauce, but it was nicely grilled with a good char.  I would recommend these menu items!  
                  Love their Mac and cheese! It&#39;s has a different flavoring, which makes it unique. I ordered a tri tip sandwich and it was good! It was served on an onion bun and had bbq sauce all over it. It also came with small side of coleslaw.   They have a variety of food from burgers to sandwiches. Highly recommend trying out one of their items and sides. Decent pricing, a sandwich and side was about $18 ($13 for the sandwich and $3 for the side).  
                  The best pork ribs ever!!! I have yet to find a bbq place that has fall apart tender and juicy ribs, but now I have! It&#39;s expensive ($28) but comes with 2 sides of coleslaw. The strawberry bbq sauce that it comes with is delicious too! The staff don&#39;t look too friendly.  
                  Mmm so good and I don&#39;t usually default to BBQ ish type places as my first choice. Their French Dip and pastrami sandwiches are definitely on-point  without the usual high markups that lots of French Dip and pastrami specialty sandwiches have.   Also tried their mac and cheese as well as their polenta bites. Both were served piping hot and flavors were on-point as well.  
                  After many drinks, I decided to grab some appetizer type foods for my friends while hanging out at the San Pedro Square Market. I decided on Bray because I love barbeque with my beer and that is what we were drinking at the moment.   I decided on the appetizer plate which included Mac and cheese, fried polenta cakes and chicken wings. We all loved it and it was enough for 4 to share and get a little of everything. I also ordered two sets of sliders, pulled pork and chicken which were perfect and since there were four of each slider - so it made it really to share.   Everything was great and affordable for a small appetizer type dinner for 4. Next time I&#39;m in town, I&#39;m going to order the brisket - those photos are making me hungry!  
                  The BBQ sauce son. Dem wings too...like whoa. Mac and Cheese doe...  
                  Came here with my friends for an early dinner. There was no line and the food was prepared quickly since it was kind of an off hour. I couldn&#39;t make up my mind on what I wanted to order. The man who took my order recommended I try the French Dip Sandwich. It was delicious. The horseradish was pretty strong which was expected, so make sure you like horseradish before ordering it. The meat was cooked just right and the bun was very tasty. I also ordered a side of baked mac and cheese. It definitely had a unique taste but it was pretty good. It was cheesy and warm and just the right amount for a side.   I was very satisfied with my food as well as the service.  
                  Mmmmm yum!!  We ordered the pulled pork sliders and the mac and cheese and the bleu cheese and bacon slaw. :9 yummy !! All delicious. Lost one star for running out of their ribs :(  
                  I was very impressed with a few aspects of this eatery.   I love the art on the walls and the style of food they serve.   I loved the fact that during a pre Sharks game rush I was notified my order would take 15-25mins before I even ordered. It was out sooner than that.   But mostly I love that during that rush, one of the top guys came out from behind the kitchen to tell me about gluten free options. Some restaurants handle this question like its a hassle to ask about their ingredients or to guide them through the menu. This guy didn&#39;t and was very polite and friendly about it. And, even though they were very busy, he never gave me the impression that he was rushing to get rid of me.   Customer service like that is A+ and sadly it is very rare these days.   And the food?  My group loved it. Wings, Tri tip, grilled veggies, and ribs.. All flavorful and delicious with good portions.   What an awesome spot to fuel up at when you&#39;re downtown.  
                  Bray never disappoints! The food is great!! from the excellent pork sliders to the juicy BBQ chicken sandwich. This eatery and staff kill it! Thank you.  
                  Almost a year now and I still love this place! I&#39;ve tried new dishes since then and have not been disappointed, ever. Weird, I&#39;m usually the one to complain.  I love the sliders, grilled chicken and tri-tip skewers and the apple pear walnut salad. Mac n cheese and tri-tip plate, still the fave. Customer service is still on point. Great place to eat!  
                  By far the best place to eat inside San Pedro square, from the fast service, to the above quality food. Some of my favorites to get are the corn (lime, cotija cheese and other spices) off the hook and the tri tip plate which is perfectly cooked and comes with a house made bbq sauce that is the jam!!!  It&#39;s awesome I&#39;ve been going so much that Mike the guy at the front end knows my order before I even have to say.  Grab a beer and a plate you won&#39;t be disappointed  
                  I have to give it up to the team at Bray Butcher Shop and Bistro but most importantly to the owner/proprietor who busts his ass to make sure the line is moving at an acceptable pace and the food gets out at a reasonable time.   During most active filled days when downtown events lure hungry crowds to the square, the wait to receive your food can take upwards of up to 25 mins. Be a smart cookie, order your food, snag a seat or order your beer across the way while your food is being prepared.  The tri-tip is a tried and trusted dish that never fails me. Either on its own or between those tasty onion buns, you won&#39;t be disappointed with the flavor and tenderness. However, after our most recent visit during this chaotic holiday weekend as we bar hopped, decided on a few side items to hold me over and soak up the brews; pork sliders, baked mac and cheese and grilled corn.   It was my drunk ass&#39;s fault for not reading my receipt after paying and been served grilled veggies instead of grilled corn when order was up. Was I slurring when i said grilled corn? Likely. Should the cashier repeat the order back before completing the order? On most occasions yes, and when the volume in the space is amplified, always.  Now I have nothing against grilled veggies and was happy to have them as part of my meal but they went out of their way to throw on a grilled corn for me if i didn&#39;t mind waiting an addtl five mins. What a great crew to make this accommodation for a bonehead like me. The owner apologized for the delay and I took it as a nice gesture on his part even though he wasn&#39;t at complete fault. The sentiment alone has turned me to a loyal customer indeed.   Note: other greats- fried polenta, wedge salad and the artichoke dip they had on special this week was outstanding!  
                  The honey and I dropped into San Pedro Square Market for some quick bites. Everything else had a huge line and an astronomical wait time.  Enter in Bray.  The service was fantastically friendly and quick. I literally wasn&#39;t done ordering as they handed me my pulled pork sliders! I even ended up coming back for seconds they were so good!  The price for the amount of pulled pork I got was wonderful! two overflowing and stuffed slider for 6 bucks! Heaven!  I&#39;d definitely be back anytime!  
                  Mind you, i only get one thing there: Pastrami Reuben. $10.90 (incl tax)  Meat: Every time, perfectly tender/moist, excellent pepper balance Dressing: Deceptively light and great companion Sauerkraut: (thank god!) light on the vinegar, cuts right through the meat Bread: Marble Rye, enough said! They get it fresh everyday from a local bakery  Ya, at times there&#39;s a decent wait. But what are you going to do; overpay for sushi or pho or regret the spuds later? The cherry on top is that you can actually buy the meat they offer. I&#39;ve bought the pastrami twice and even after it being in the fridge for two days, it still tasted the same as the first day. Now that&#39;s quality! No other place makes it better.  
                  BBQ pork sliders are yum! Husband and I got the 4 for $10, good for a lite-ish meal. Located in San Pedro Square, nice place to eat and kick back. Definitely recommend!  
                  Tri Tip Plate  If you can cut tri tip with a plastic knife like butter you know you have super tender meat. Combined with flavor packed goodness bite after bite, you my friend have something good going on. Each piece was infused with flavor and found myself wanting to go back for more and more. My one gripe is that some pieces were overpowering in pepper flavor and left an uncomfortable heat on my palate. That aside, the meat was out of the park  I was amazed at how meaty each bite was and not mushy at all unlike other tri tips I have had in the past. It was equally beautiful to look at, a vibrant rare pink throughout with a perfect smoke ring on the edge.   Unfortunately, the sides were nowhere as good. The hawaiian rolls weren&#39;t toasted or warmed through and the coleslaw was just your average run of the mill. While slightly disappointing, it only helped to highlight just how amazing the tri tip was!  Overall Thoughts  Thank god I am a carnivore!  
                  The tri tip plate takes about 25 minutes to make. That&#39;s 25 agonizing minutes of imagining this peppery, juicy, tender meat being crushed slowly in your mouth...so I accepted their pager and ran off somewhere to get my mind off of this fantasy. The best part of this plate is being allowed to substitute the slaw and the buns with another of the sides on their menu. The side of grilled corn is corn on the cob covered with this heavy sauce that&#39;s spicy and delicious.  When we came back, the tri tip was laid out so nicely in thick, perfectly shaped slices. It looks like a little for the $16 you pay for, but it&#39;s a lot of rich meat to quickly fill up the hungry stomach you thought you had before this.  
                  Today was the third time i stopped here for lunch. Each time i ordered something new and was satisfied with my order. Today i was mind blown so i had to write a review  1st visit- French Dip (great)  2nd visit- Tri Tip Sandwich (Good)  3rd Visit- Pulled Pork (Amazing!!)  Meat is always tender  BBQ  has a great kick to it  Coleslaw.. i do not like it. but somehow i enjoy it here  MUST TRY.  
                  This Bistro is inside San Pedro Market Square and they&#39;re great.  Their food is a bit overpriced but you get what you pay for and their meats and flavorful and tender.  If i remember correctly, it&#39;s about $5 for their skewers and you need at least 2 or 3 to fill you up.  My co-worker did get the veggies and that portion was a pretty decent size and they were cooked to perfection.  The staff was friendly and they give you a buzzard so you can go and get something to drink elsewhere or grab a table in the meantime.  
                  The food is AMAZING!  We ordered (2) pulled pork sliders, BBQ chicken sandwich, and grilled corn with cotija &amp; lime for about $23 and it was totally worth it! The portions are beyond sufficient and the flavors are on point.   As a bonus, the staff is friendly, which is is great for a downtown San Jose establishment.   Highly recommend!  
                  Their sign, &#34;People hate us on Yelp,&#34; posted for everyone to see is quite amusing when they have an overall rating of 4 stars with over 130 reviews. It seems as if they need attention and affection, so here I am giving them the love they deserve because I had a freakin&#39; great sandwich.  Their menu has a lot of things going on. On our first visit, we asked the owner what he would recommend. Of course, to him everything on the menu is great but that&#39;s not really helpful to us. He got defensive with our questions so we ordered...uh...what did we order?!?! I had to look back at my pics to see and was surprised that I rated the ribs and sliders 4 stars. That meal was forgettable. On our second visit (7 months later), I just turned to Yelp to decide what to order. The corned beef reuben seemed to be a big hit with Yelpers and it roused my curiosity. So I took a risk: 1) I&#39;m not that into sandwiches. Out of all the choices we have to eat in San Jose, I would never choose a sandwich...except if it&#39;s peanut butter and jelly or maybe a pork belly sandwich; 2) sauerkraut is blechhhhhh; and 3) rye is weird to me. Somehow this place managed to put all this together and made one helluva corned beef sandwich that I enjoyed. Now that is truly impressive. The coleslaw that came with the sandwich was surprisingly good. The baked mac and cheese was way better than I had the first time. I&#39;m glad I gave this place another chance. Mr. Bray, no need to stress. Keep calm and make more kick ass sandwiches!  
                  Delicious and huge salads here - plenty to split between two so that you can order their other items! Seasonally, the peaches are a no go, but they&#39;re currently serving a pear and raspberry salad instead. I typically add a skewer to my salad and it actually comes with a full breast of chicken! The simple grilled chicken is flavorful and juicy and marries well with the sweet barbecue sauce.   I also really like the varied menu so that you can order a little bit of something (e.g. a slider, a skewer, a cup of soup, a Mexican corn, mac and cheese...) to fill you up. Bray is one of the few that also offers a pager for you to wait for your order.  Check out their menu online and give them a try. Highly recommended for simple and delicious (and some healthy) options in SPSM.  
                  Fucking awesome place to enjoy lunch dinner brunch snack birthday Christmas everything....staff is awesome also!!! Jesse is the most friendliest person you will ever meet!!! Gives out free hugs also!!! Juan man of few words but has a killer smile!!!! Josh the owner is a great guy always smiling always happy and puts out the best food in the market!!! My personal favorite is the Reuben hands down best one I&#39;ve ever had I usually do corned beef and Cole slaw with mines and they always accommodate me!!!! Don&#39;t sleep on the friend polenta also super tasty ,bbq can&#39;t beat also and now and now!!!! They are doing seasonal soups!!! What&#39;s not to love!!! Bray number one spot in the market.  
                  Honestly, THE best bacon I&#39;ve ever had at any time, any place, in my entire life. Seriously.  
                  If you&#39;re looking for the prefect grilled cheese- you know the gooey, melty, cheesy kind with crunchy, toasty bread, you&#39;ll find it at Bray! Do yourself a favor and go try it!  
                  Extremely disappointed. The quality was just a miss. I did not find the prices justifiable considering the quantity and quality. Will probably not eat here again.  I got the Pear Salad with a Jerk Chicken Skewer on the side (total came out to be $11). With a purchase of the salad, all skewers are 50%, so my skewer was only $2! Sadly, the chicken was pretty dry and not very well-seasoned. In fact, I&#39;m not really sure what flavor I was eating.. The pear salad was pretty good, with refreshing pear slices, walnuts, and raspberries. Overall though, it was just ohhhhkay.   Food is kinda slow to come. I waited maybe 10 minutes for my salad &amp; chicken. My friend waited over 10 minutes for his ribs...  
                  I love this spot!! Honestly I should eat here more! I know this place has tons of great protein options but one of my favorite things to order here is the Mac-n-cheese! It&#39;s got a great southwest profile and is super unique and tasty! But obviously the BBQ is bomb too. I love the wings, the pulled pork sliders, the tri-tip and the ribs! I&#39;ve tried it all! Get what I recommend and you won&#39;t be disappointed.  
                  Something that I love about San Pedro Square is that no matter what you are craving that day, you can get it here and it will be delicious. Bray Butcher Block and Bistro is no exception. I have ordered from here a few times and each time was great!   My favorite by far is the French Dip. My mouth is watering as I write this review. It comes on a pepper crusted onion roll with pepper jack cheese, horseradish, and aus jus. I usually like my food a little spicy and they offered to give me a side of sliced jalepenos. That really hit the spot. I literally cannot wait to come back for another french dip.  Great service and succulent meats! What more can you ask for?  
                  Finger licking good bbq!   Tried the chicken skewers and all of the slider variations - so well seasoned with some excellent bbq sauce (that I wish they would sell in bottles!) Only downside is that they use Hawaiian roles for the sliders, so if you don&#39;t eat them asap, they get too soggy from all the saucey goodness.    Really love the sides: mac n cheese (not sure what seasoning is added to it, but this is not yo grandmother&#39;s mac n cheese, it&#39;s kicked up a notch as Emeril would say), blue cheese slaw, jalapeño polenta, all so so good.  
                  AMAZING!!! Had the jerk  spiced chicken skewers, grilled veggies and grilled corn on the cob. Honestly the BEST chicken I have ever had and the corn was delicious!! A must try!  
                  I have a friend who loves to try new things...im not I&#39;m picky bit had lunch with friends and at first I was skeptical  about this place but one I had it it was so good and fresh and of course we had a million questions and the staff was so kind and helpful. ....will definitely visit again...  
                  I&#39;m trying to be positive with 3 stars because of the general impression that this place gives you.. The food was good but not very authentic as it looked so you would think &#34;why didn&#39;t I just do that at home?&#34; A slight touch is good when making a signature sandwich, whatever that might be. So The Reuben was good and the coleslaw salad, just get fries instead or tell them to keep it. Hopefully next time I&#39;ll try something else and change my mind about this awesome looking place!  
                  Love this place! The little Mac and cheese and pulled pork sliders are a perfect little snack!  
                  First off let me say how fortunate I am to find this place by mistake. Bary is a diamond in the rough. The owner, Josh Hanoka jack of all trades, is pumping out a delicious menu he created himself. Josh&#39;s food is nothing short of amazing. Here&#39;s what I had:  I went with a classic, The Ruban-Corned beef or pastrami, sauerkraut, Swiss cheese, Russian dressing, on marbled rye. Josh gave me half pastrami and half corned beef with a generous portion of meat. This place reminds me of Taza Bistro on Santa Clara st, for those who had the pleasure of eating there.   Then I ordered a jerk spice chicken skewer, spiced with a kick and cut thin.   Did I mention chef Josh makes all of creations from scratch! Josh only purchases nothing but the hugest quality grass fed products.   I finished stuffing myself with 6 of his wings- twice baked and less time in the fryer changed the way I look at wings, this place is bringing back the wing for sure. Smoked perfect and the taste will scare your tongue and leave you wanting more.   My hats off to the generous and talented chef Josh.   You can&#39;t pass up a chance to stop by the San Pedro Market to check this place out!  
                  I come here for the delicious pulled pork sliders. THE BEST!!!  
                  This place is a GO TO when it comes to good, quality food cravings. I&#39;ve had nearly everything on the menu, from the irresistible Reuben to the black and blue salad (add avocado) when I&#39;m on that no carb flow. Ok and THE CORN RUB - I could seriously marinate my life with that shit. Also, the staff are genuine, well-rounded individuals who take pride in their meat and keep it mellow in order to provide outstanding customer service.   In short, save yourself the time scavenging around the Market for food when you can satisfy your meat cravings at Bray :-)  
                  Man, I love San Pedro Square Market! This is yet another 5 star experience for me. Today I tried Bray Butcher Block and went with the Pastrami Reuben Sandwich for lunch. On the Reuben you have a choice of Corned Beef or Pastrami, both made in house and available to go from the deli counter... The Pastrami was some of the best I&#39;ve had, ever! I only wish there was a bit more of it. The sandwich was served on fresh marbled rye bread with sauerkraut, swiss cheese, and russian dressing. It came with a very small cup of very tasty coleslaw. The only way this sandwich could have been better is if I ordered two of them.     I&#39;ll definitely be back but next time I&#39;m trying the barbeque as I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just as awesome...  
                  In the land of average food bray kicks it out of the park! I&#39;ve now had almost everything on their menu and it is all top notch!  The only thing that keeps them from a full five stars is that they refused to give a taste of their corned beef before I bought a pound so I didn&#39;t buy one.  Oh well!  
                  I&#39;ve tried practically everything in San Pedro Square Market. I was so excited when a new place opened up. I finally had the opportunity to try it when I was in the area for some offsite work.   I thought their menu was extensive, in comparison to some of the other places in San Pedro Square. You can have ribs, brisket, a wide variety of sandwiches, chili, and so on. They even have a number of sides to choose from, like mac and cheese, fried polenta, corn, and more. I went with the turkey chili bowl that came with polenta. It&#39;s a good serving size, but you might not feel full if you&#39;re extremely hungry. The chili was slightly spicy, along with the fried jalapeño polenta. Topped off with cheese, green onions and avocado, it was very warming comfort food. I&#39;ll definitely have to be back for their ribs and sandwiches!  
                  Read pretty good reviews on this place and happened to be looking for a new spot to eat at the San Pedro Market today, I was sure glad to knock this one off my &#34;bookmarks&#34; list!   I decided to opt for their 1/4 lb rack of ribs and a bottled root beer, waited about 10 minutes due to the noon time rush here and picked up my food. The ribs were spare ribs and tender, but not fall off the bone. The sauce was a strawberry- chipotle BBQ sauce which tasted great due to it&#39;s sweetness and delayed, slight spiciness. It came with a bleu cheese and bacon coleslaw, which was really good with the chunks of bacon bits- though I didn&#39;t really taste the bleu cheese. It was really refreshing to it and tbh I&#39;m not even a fan of cole slaw in general, but it was pretty darn good!   For my meal and drink it was about $11-12, which is good for the quality and flavor of food here for lunch.  Can&#39;t wait to come back to try other items on their menu :-)  
                  Reasonably priced, fucking awesome food. Baked mac &#39;n cheese and wings are so good, you may cry. I know I did.  
                  The corned beef Reuben was probably the best Rueben I&#39;ve ever had.   Bray is a nice little butcher shop that whip up slightly more expensive than usually sandwiches, but also give slightly more than usual amounts of meat, which is nice.   Their Rueben is AMAZING. I don&#39;t care how you feel about corned beef. I don&#39;t care how you feel about sauerkraut. Just get it an let your life be changed.  Perfectly toasted with just the right amount of cabbage to balance out the corned beef = perfection. Cant emphasize it enough.   I&#39;ve also had their French dip, but the highly absorbent bread didn&#39;t go well, especially after the masterpiece Rueben.   Overall a great place if you want something classier than Togos or a Rueben. It IS a bit expensive but worth giving a shot!  
                  I&#39;m not really a barbecue fan, but this place is amazing. They use high quality ingredients, all grass fed meats, no nitrates, minimally processed, and I think almost everything is made from scratch. The Turkey chili is so so good, even if I&#39;m not in the mood for Bbq food, I stop by and order a cup of it. They also have grilled corn with cheese and some spicy lime which is yum. And they are always happy to answer any questions you may have about their food  
                  Oh my, this place is good. And handily located in San Pedro Square near my favorite beer vendor. What more could a girl ask for eh? The French Dip is delicious with lots of horseradish to keep you munchin&#39;. We also go back regularly for the pulled pork and the tri-tip. YUM/  
                  This place is such a great addition to the San Pedro Square Market line-up! My boyfriend and I came here on a Saturday and decided on Bray for our lunch and it did not disappoint! The service was awesome - the guy even helped carry food over to our booth over on the other side of the market while I staked our claim at the table.  - The Pear Salad was sooo good and fresh - Jalapeno Polenta (insert heart eyed emoji here) - Corn on the Cob is pretty darn spicy but addicting-ly good  
                  Sliders, skewers, and sides OH MY! (There are also salads &amp; sammies, I think, but that would have been to much alliteration...)  *really close to a fifth-star, just want to try more stuff off the menu first!*  I had the eager pleasure of checking out Bray&#39;s for dinner yesterday and came away really satisfied and hopeful for their success. Eateries in San Pedro Square can be hit-or-miss, in my opinion; its a tough market to satisfy considering all the different kinds of people that come to the Square, but Bray&#39;s strikes a perfect balance of finessed, good food that&#39;s affordable and approachable. It&#39;s their opening week and already seem to be doing well!  Pulled pork sliders ($3 each OR 4 for $10!) are deceptively bellybombtastic - each slider may only be three hearty (or five dainty) bites of food, but the liberally sauced pork and creamy slaw on hawaiian sweet rolls is a rich, dense, savory construct. I had two, wanting to try more than just one thing from the menu. I can imagine 4 of these bad boys could put you right into a meaty sleep.  Chicken skewers ($2 each?) were a satisfying accompaniment and really showcase how attuned this butcher shop is - two tenders per skewer were lightly seasoned and cooked to a perfect temperature, appreciatively juicy.   The side of bleu &amp; bacon slaw was somewhat understated, less potent that I had hoped, with only hints of either bacon or bleu. Being that there is slaw in the sliders already, I would forego this side and opt for some thing else (next time: I&#39;m hitting up that mac-n-cheese...).  Friendly service and genuine pleasantries round out the experience (the people that work here seem sincerely invested in their customers and are rightfully proud of their food craft) , furthering the refreshing, homey feel of SPSM. Bray&#39;s might be my new go-to... _______________________________________ Bray&#39;s Butcher Block &amp; Bistro + Market Beer Co. = one full &amp; happy mikey u. #thisiswhyImfat, and I&#39;m okay with that.  
                  4 stars.  I ordered the French Dip on an onion bun w/ au jus and a side of coleslaw.   Wait time for food can be long but it&#39;s Cooked-to-order and flavorful.  Final Thoughts: Would order from this place again when in San Pedro Square.  
                  Ordered the Tri-Tip, slaw and mac &amp; cheese.  Tri-Tip was just ok. Kinda rare and not that great. Slaw was good as was the Mac &amp; Cheese. Best part of the experience was the cool outdoor patio.  
                  I ordered a sandwich which came with a side of coleslaw and macaroni.  The entire plate was mediocre. The coleslaw had little to no flavor, I&#39;ve had way better. The macaroni had WAY too much paprika I think it was on top of it and did not taste good, very generic.   The sandwich itself was ok. I&#39;ve had way better meat and the bread was the best part.  I left very unimpressed.  
                  Bray Butcher Block and Bistro, located right next to Konjoe Burger, is yet another great food stand at San Pedro Square Market.  Going off of suggestions/pictures on Yelp, as well as my own love for this sandwich, I decided to try their Reuben with Corned Beef. If you can make a great Reuben sandwich, then you&#39;ve got my vote, and this place doesn&#39;t disappoint. Their corned beef was well seasoned and tender, the coleslaw was tart and crisp and their sliced marbled-rye bread had a nice crunchy crust yet the bread was unbelievably soft.  The service was quick and the staff was very friendly. Having worked in the customer service industry, it&#39;s amazing what a simple friendly smile and acknowledgement of a guest&#39;s presence can do for your business&#39; reputation. So if you&#39;re craving a good sandwich, and you&#39;re in the neighborhood, stop by Bray Butcher Block and Bistro and try them out!  
                  This place, inside San Pedro Market,  serves the best French Dip I&#39;ve ever had anywhere! Bar none.  I&#39;m serious. I&#39;m almost over middle aged and have ate a lot of French Dip from a lot of places. I&#39;ve never had one this good; ever.   Even the bread with herbs is good. Usually, one is bummed when they run out of Aju sauce. This sandwich is so good, you don&#39;t even sweat it when you are out; it tastes perfect without it.   I plan to be back many times!  
                  Not as good as i thought it would be... The meat was not very good, I had to be wait a long time to get it; and staff was a little rude.  
                  Good barbecue, but they just overdo the sauce &amp; spices a bit.  The Tri-Tip sandwich would have been perfect with about half as much bbq sauce. I would definitely order it with lite sauce next time.  The baked macaroni and cheese had zesty blackening spices on top, which would have been good, if they hadn&#39;t been piled on there so thick that they were a crust. I would probably skip the mac &amp; cheese next time in favor of some fries.   They have a pretty limited selection of beverages here. But, because it is part of the market, it is pretty easy to snag your preferred beverage at another kiosk.  
                  My favorites at Bray include the grilled corn with cotija cheese... Um.  Yum.  Then, the chicken or steak skewers are the perfect 4-5oz sizes recommended as serving size... And perfectly spiced to deliciousness. Bray is something I cannot go without for too long.  
                  One of the best spots in SPSM. This place has uniquely flavored BBQ and boy do they know how to do it right. I have had the pleasure of trying several items off of their menu and my absolute favorite is still their pulled pork sliders. I have no idea what they use for their BBQ but it is awesome sauce...literally. I really want to try their mac n cheese because it looks epic, but I have yet to do so. I&#39;m a little sad they took don&#39;t have SJSU student ID card discounts anymore, but hey I guess business is business. Overall, if you&#39;re looking for something delicious to go with your drinks from SPSM or are just hungry for some bomb food then you must try out Bray&#39;s.  
                  My husband and I decided to order/share some spicy chicken wings, a grilled cheese sandwich, and a black and blue (wedge) salad for dinner. In other words, all-American comfort food. We were impressed by the the quality of the food: simple, delicious, and made with love. The salad had perfectly-cooked bacon along with yummy blue cheese crumbles- like a good relationship, they make each other better. ;-) They not only validated my parking but my belief in good BBQ and customer service. We definitely will be going back to try other menu items at Bray!  
                  My pastrami Reuben was very good and would have earned 4 solid stars. What made me give 5 stars has tondo with the excellent customer service by Josh, the owner. I also ordered 6 of the smoked, fried chicken wings. As I was placing both the Reuben and wings on a tray, the plate if wings fell out of my hands and crashed to the floor. Without any hesitation, Josh ran from behind the counter to pick up my mess and ordered his kitchen to whip up another order right away. I was sorry for my accident and pleasantly surprised by this thoughtful gesture. The wings were crispy and flavorful. I appreciate good food but also value great service and professionalism. Josh earned my loyalty and will also get the business of my friends and family the next time we&#39;re in San Jose. Good job, Josh!  
                  The French dip was fantastic, there was a special horseradish spread on it that kicked it up a notch.  We got a side of there corn on the cob with some kind of spicey spread on it.  Food was ready fast and for a reasonable price also good slaw.  Love the outside atmosphere.  
                  Super friendly staff in a cool little larger-than-life food court. The menu is small, but big enough to have something on it for everyone. The blue cheese slaw was a lil bland, but still a nice compliment to the main entrees. If you are going to a Sharks game, or just downtown, I suggest you swing by and give this place a try  
                  Just had lunch with my friends here OMG delicious I had the chicken sliders,mac and cheese and polenta.. I wanted to try the pork sliders but they were out so they gave me a 10 % off next order ... Score!!  My close minded ,never want to try anything new friends loved it too ! Employees are super friendly,definitely coming back!  
                  Great sandwiches and even better service. The young lady from New England who is the director of first impressions is the best employee in the entire market! She is personable and made a fantastic recommendation for the Reuben sandwich. We need more people who take pride I their work. I will be back for an awesome sandwich again very soon!  
                  I didn&#39;t get a sense of warm service here... maybe they were stressed out from how busy the place was (just before a sharks game). I ordered the turkey chili, fire roasted corn with pimiento chili mayo/sauce, and a side of mac n cheese. The food was on the expensive side, and right after I ordered, the cashier put up a &#34;30 min wait&#34; sign. Yikes! Luckily, I only waited about 20. The chili was good, had a nice kick to it, and I loved the corn. The mac and cheese was bland for me though.  I&#39;d come back to try their other menu items, but probably only when it&#39;s not so crazy busy.  
                  Had the &#34;Black &amp; Blue&#34; salad (wedge), with two &#34;Jerk Chicken&#34; skewers on the side (4oz each)... Bacon was crisp, buttermilk Blue Cheese dressing was freshly made. Best of all chicken was perfectly seasoned and grilled! Great, &#34;clean&#34; eating...(Well, except for the Grapefruit Sculpin beer I bought nearby!).  Festive food court atmosphere, great for the game, and times with friends...  
                  Bray has some of the most delicious sliders and corned beef Reubens I&#39;ve ever had! Growing up in an Irish neighborhood, corned beef was a staple. Moving to San Jose yielded a diverse plethora of foods but lacked a really good corned beef sandwich. Bray met that need and more with their sliders and Mac n cheese. Delicious food and I love San Pedro markets ambiance, so perfect combo!  
                  I had the 1/2 rack of saint Louis ribs with house BBQ sauce.  Ribs were meaty and tender but the flavor profile of the BBQ sauce was off.  Way too much cumin.  If you like BBQ sauce that tastes like taco seasoning maybe you will like it   Moreover there was not even a hint of smoke on these ribs .  these were oven cooked and their claim that ribs were from a smoker is disingenuous unless that pig likes Marlboros.  28 dollars for half rack with 2 sodas.  When will people ever learn. Good BBQ can never be pretentious.  
                  After drooling over the yelp images it occurred to me that I had passed by this place several times while at San Pedro Square without even putting two and two together.   The menu and signage design draws you in, but a little difficult to decipher since they do offer meat by the lbs as well at in sides and sandwiches.   I had the cornedbeef reuben along with a jerk chicken skewer. The sandwich itself was hearty and visually appealing. Nice meat to sauerkraut ratio. However, I felt that some bites were much saltier than others which could have been the result to an uneven seasoning distribution. Chicken skewer was a different jerk taste than I am used to, but it was good and juicy. Slaw was surprisingly impressive, which has me wondering if it&#39;s in house?  The pastrami was recommended to me on several occasions so that&#39;ll probably be something to try on a later visit. Mac and cheese as well.  
                  Bray is absolute favorite place to eat when I come to San Pedro Square Market.  I never thought I would eat here because I am a vegetarian and this place is a carnivore&#39;s dream. However, the vegetarian options offered are so good! Try the pear salad. It is not only huge but it is fresh and delicious. Whatever you do, do NOT forget to order the jalapeno and cheddar polenta! These are so unbelievably delicious! I cannot remember specifically but I believe the order comes with either 2 or 3 polenta cakes. Each cake is perfectly crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The perfect texture and cheesy consistency with a nice kick of spice from the jalapeno. I order it every time I come to the square.  I had the chance to chat with the owner and he is such a nice man. He is very friendly and really knows his meats. He gave my boyfriend a brief 101 on different cuts, prime, choice, and other things that I had no knowledge of. Meat talk is complete gibberish to me. I also know that the owner does his best to go as local as possible when it comes to his food. I really appreciated this because I live a very healthy/organic lifestyle.   There is a bit of a wait for your food but that is because they put a lot of care and detail into their food preparation. They chefs make sure that your meat is cooked exactly how you want it and that everything looks and tastes delicious.   Amazing.
