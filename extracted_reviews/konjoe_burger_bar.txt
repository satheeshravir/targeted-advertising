                  I apologize that yesterday was my first time here.  I always wonder why there&#39;s always a long line of people...now I know ..It&#39;s not a hype, people.  It is the real deal!!  Good Burger!!!  Cool Service!!!  I just had the regular burger...nothing fancy ..I ordered mine medium rare..juicy burger of course and the trimmings that came with it was fresh...but most of all....tah dah!!  The Bun!!!  ooh it was divine!  I get to taste their fries with that spicy sauce..I really liked it!!    Next time though...I will try the more fancy burger..like the one jalapeno burger.  
                  I&#39;ve only tried their pork buns, but it&#39;s a must whenever I come to San Pedro Square Market. Super flavorful pork belly stuffed in little buns, always leaves me happy.   The service is a okay and usually takes awhile for the food to be ready.   I have yet to try their burgers, but my friend swears by their pork belly burger.  
                  I&#39;d only been to San Pedro Square once before but it was on the other side of where Konjoe was located so I didn&#39;t know of it at the time.  My friend suggested this place to me, and I&#39;m always down to try new places so I said let&#39;s go. The menu was pretty simple, which I liked, so I was able to order without any hassle. My friend and I both ordered their house burger and shared an order of fries. We just got 2 cups of water to drink. The food took about 5-10 min for the food to come out, which I thought was a fair time. I had just gotten my braces tightened the previous day so I had to eat my burger with a fork and knife (like a loser).  The burger was nice and juicy and the fries were crispy. I really enjoyed the whole meal. I will most likely be coming back.  
                  Nestled inside San Pedro Square market, this place makes asian-inspired burgers. To be honest, I&#39;ve only eaten their pork bao burgers and not their actual burgers. The steamed bao is nice and soft, the way they are in Chinese restaurants, and it reminds me of the Taiwanese gua bao, which is perhaps what inspired this in the first place. The sauces that come with the fries are delicious as well, and it&#39;s a rather large serving, so you can definitely share with friends.  After you order, they give you a buzzer which works inside the building as well as the outdoors eating outside. It can take awhile, so I would recommend finding a seat shortly after ordering and you and your company can take turns getting your food.  
                  In Texas, there&#39;s a hole in the wall chain called Burger Tex that offers a bulgogi burger. It&#39;s essentially marinated beef in between two buns with some of the usual burger condiments milling about, and it&#39;s grungy, cheap, and kind of excellent.  None of the above applies to Konjoe. Located in San Pedro Square Market, Konjoe offers upscale casual with a price tag to match. That&#39;s fine as a lifestyle and dining choice, but the burger doesn&#39;t offer the same payoff.   The Korean-styled burger isn&#39;t made of bulgogi, but rather the standard ground beef hamburger patty, theoretically infused with Korean marinade. I didn&#39;t taste much, and therein lies the rub. It&#39;s a rather tasteless burger, obligated to be supported by its buddies. The Konjoe sauce appears to be a Big Mac thousand island derivative, perhaps with a splash of gochujang. I foodie-added a fried egg, making it a Konjoe burger proper rather than just the basic. That was fine.  Maybe the pork belly or shiitake burgers there are more novel or better-tasting. I&#39;m not sure. As it was, the beef burger was fine but nothing special.  
                  5 stars for daily special pork belly special on fries!!!!! The pork belly is so crunchy is served with melting cheddar cheese with special mayonese sauce!! I was so emotional that I have not known this awesome place before!!  
                  This may be the best burger in the downtown area of San Jose. The burgers can be pricey if you choose to take it to the next level and add an egg and pork belly. I would recommend the basic burger or the Konjoe burger with pork belly. The meat is a perfect medium and still juicy. I hope my arteries don&#39;t clog eating too many burgers but they must be using 80/20 or something that packs flavor.  The fries are not included with the burger but are fairly cheap ($2.50). If you&#39;re thirsty I recommend the lemonade as it is not too sweet and tart.   If you&#39;re in San Pedro Square Market area and want a great burger I would highly recommend eating at Konjoe.  
                  My husband and I came for lunch based on fellow Yelper reviews. It is located in the San Pedro Market so a counter service place with plenty of communal seating in the marketplace.   We ordered the basic burger which comes with a lot on it:  cheese, lettuce, tomato, grilled onion and konjoe sauce (which is similar to thousand island dressing). The burger was perfectly cooked and served on a bun that was a little sweet (similar to Hawaiian roll). It was very tasty. Fries are good and a very generous size. We loved them with the house sauce.   Would definitely come back. Service was done with a smile and although there was a line, we didn&#39;t feel rushed ordering.  
                  Such unique burgers! Konjoe burger is located inside the San Pedro Square right next to the pho place. Their decorations are very chic and service is quick and prompt and accurate. There are a few burger choices but I actually like it when I don&#39;t have a HUGE menu because I can become very indecisive. I went with the huge special which is called the Konjoe burger. BTW I just want to say their website is equally chic and user friendly! What caught my attention with this burger is the fried egg that is inside and jalapenos because I like my food with an extra kick! My friend and I also shared the fries and we were allowed to choose some sauces. You can pick more than 1 so we decided on the spicy ketchup and also a mayo one.   There are plenty of seating since it&#39;s like a food court. My burger was absolutely delicious!! I would say it&#39;s better than The Counter burgers and maybe even on par with in and out (omg). The reason i say that is because the burger has a unique crispiness to it. Every bite has a crunch and is delicious! The burger can get a bit messy and wet so grab a lot of napkin! They do wrap the burger up for you so if you&#39;re skilled enough, you can somehow keep everything inside the wrapper, i failed. The fries were good but pretty average but I definitely appreciated the various sauces we could choose from as both the ones we got were pretty delicious. I really enjoyed this place and will definitely come back!  
                  Konjoe Burger Bar should not be confused with Konjoe Tei, which is a Japanese restaurant also in Downtown San Jose.  My friend told me she wanted to get some dumplings at Konjoe.  I told her, &#34;Look, dumbass, Konjoe has burgers, not dumplings!&#34;  Because of this argument, we are not friends anymore.  Or, maybe It&#39;s the way I told her.  Hmmmm......  Either way, I don&#39;t want you to lose friends over this.  But, once you get over the confusion in names, KBB has some delicious burgers.  You wouldn&#39;t really think so with the unassuming storefront in San Pedro Square Market.  Also, the menu isn&#39;t very extensive.  But, that&#39;s why it&#39;s good.  They don&#39;t do a lot of things mediocre.  They do a few things exceptionally well.  While my friends told me to get the pork belly burger, I said, f@#$ them, and got the Konjoe burger (it&#39;s a wonder my friends don&#39;t like me).  The Konjoe burger is made with a well-seasoned beef patty, grilled onions, cheese and lettuce.  But, then, they kick it up a notch (can you really read that and not think of Emeril Lagasse) and add their special Konjoe sauce, pickled jalapeños, and my all-time favorite add-on to a burger, a fried egg.  If you&#39;re thinking this sounds like it might get a little messy, then you&#39;re wrong.  It&#39;s A LOT messy!  But, definitely in a good way.  When you go to a specialty burger place, a good indication it will be good, is the messiness factor.  I&#39;m not talking about grease running down your fingers.  I&#39;m talking about JUICE and sauce running down your fingers!  KBB has a good way of satiating your craving for a delicious hamburger and not making you feel like you just ate a silo of animal byproduct.    I did try the pork belly burger on another visit and it was good, just as my friends were saying.  But, it&#39;s not really a &#34;burger&#34; in my eyes.  And plus, if I&#39;m going to indulge and eat pork belly, it&#39;ll definitely be from The Chairman food truck.  
                  Been to San Predo Market/Food Court many times but in the daytime and not for food! First-timer here!  Friend recommended I try this place for the burgers BUT wasn&#39;t feeling that and decided to be adventurous--I ended up ordering the pork baos--seared/roasted pork belly piece (large piece!) sandwiched in a steamed bao w/ roasted apple slice, hoisan sauce/spicy mayo, and green onions. I actually asked for the sauces on the side (I always do to control sauce portions and it won&#39;t be too spicy/salty). Order was ~$11 for 3 pork baos and I tipped $2 (although I got my order to go) because the guy at the register was really nice and friendly, asking me about my day and all.  Price- it is a little pricey for 3 small pork baos. I wasn&#39;t too hungry though so it was the perfect portion for me. Looking at the menu, average price is $11-13 for a burger/bao/other items.  Taste- pork belly had nice sear on outside and chewy/soft/melt-in-your-mouth inside. Hoison sauce and spicy mayo added a nice sweetness/spiciness kick that didn&#39;t overpower the nicely seasoned pork belly and wasn&#39;t overwhelmingly heavy. The bao itself was soft and fluffy--liked that it wasn&#39;t too thin/flimsy to hold up all the goodies inside. Green onions/roasted apple slice added nice touch of freshness and lightened the meal.  Vibe/atmosphere- came here around 12:15 pm on a Tuesday and was surprised the food court wasn&#39;t too packed/line not very long. Line was actually longer for the vietnamese counter right next to it.  Would I come back? Maybe...it was a little pricey but I&#39;m always down to try a juicy burger! (Well...at least I hope it&#39;s juicy)  
                  I love this place so much..... Pork Belly burger... the pork buns... the french fries... fast service and amazing folks behind the bar... I have never had a bad meal here before.... from paying average wait time is 10 minutes.  
                  They make burgers 6 at a time. If you go during a busy time, be prepared to wait.  
                  If there&#39;s a long line at the San Pedro Square Market it&#39;s usually for Konjoe Burger Bar.   I&#39;ve been to Konjoe a couple times now and the burgers are pretty good, but not the best burger I&#39;ve ever had.   Konjoe serves up burgers with an Asian twist like the Kalbi which is served with kimchee cucumbers and a slightly sweet Kalbi sauce.  Tasted great and the soft and fluffy bun really tied it all together. My only wish was that there was more meat. Definitely get a double patty.    Also had the signature Konjoe which comes with a fried egg on top. Pretty decadent and delicious.   I&#39;ve had the pork belly baos as well and you get three in one order. These have been hit or miss. One time, the pork belly was super fatty and the next time it was fried and dry.    The fries here are the best in the market.  Fried to order and sprinkled with a dusting of spicy chili flakes and other umami enhancers they are addicting. I just thought it was funny that the price of one order of fries (three dollars) is the same as an order of lemonade. Wouldn&#39;t the fries cost more, or the drinks were cheaper? IMO  
                  Although I&#39;ve been to San Pedro quite a few times, I&#39;ve never tried Konjoe. I&#39;m usually not one to go out and eat a burger, but I&#39;m happy I did today.   I ended up getting the Konejoe burger which consisted of a medium beef patty, fried egg, onions, jalepenos, cheese and their special Konjoe sauce. The yolk dripping down the burger as you bite into the egg was just perfect.   P.S. I love their little pickled cucumbers!   I also got their house fries which remind me of Cajun fries. MUST TRY. They were the right crispness and it also comes w/ a sauce. They also carry random flavored lemonades depending on the day. You can never go wrong with just grabbing a beer from the bar across and enjoying it with your burger though.   Chill vibes as expected for a Tuesday but San Pedro can get packed on the weekends. Parking is also metered!  
                  The best independent burger joint in San Jose, and possibly in ail of Silicon Valley. Very delicious, nutritious, and affordable.  Also the pork belly sandwich is to die for, and chicken&amp;waffles are a nice addition to round or the menu. I love a fried egg, grilled onions, and grilled mushrooms on my burger, and this place offers all 3. Though delicious, skip the cheese and the thousand-island-style sauce to eliminate unnecessary fat &amp; calories, and the result is still delicious -if not more so, since the cheese and sauce make the delicious Kobe ground beef. The fries taste like real potatoes, too!  
                  Definitely enjoyed my Konjoe burger immensely, though it felt a little spensy for something that didn&#39;t already include a side of fries.   As far as flavor and quality goes, I would say that the burgers rate as high as a burger from Umami, and *almost* as high as a burger from Bachi in Las Vegas  I snagged a &#39;Shiitake Jack&#39; and my man ordered &#39;The Basics&#39;. While the cook on my burger wasn&#39;t exactly as I specified (got medium-well, ordered medium-rare) everything else was on point. The shiitakes definitely added a great umami punch, and the burger overall was juicy and flavorful.    I almost can&#39;t imagine ordering anything else at San Pedro Market now, and look forward to trying their ramen spot in the SoFa market near by!  
                  So I asked the cashier what&#39;s the fattiest burger?! Yes it was that type of week to splurge on a meal for Friday dinner. Great recommendation to have the konjoe burger with pork belly! YUM! I had to eat the pork belly on its own to enjoy the fattyness of it all!!! I forget the sauce I had... It was quite unique and I resorted to ketchup.   $18 meal with just the burger and fries... Worth every penny! Will be back with the fiancé to basque it this place&#39;s delectable burgers!  
                  PROS:  YES, this place is as good as it gets in my humble opinion!  I had the pork belly sandwich and it was OFF THE HOOK!  NO REALLY, OFFFFFF THE HOOK!  French fries... OFF THE HOOK!  &#34;I am in love and I don&#39;t care who knows!&#34; (Will Farrow...in Elf) Location is amazing, how can anyone complain about San Pedro Square, it&#39;s a joint the WHOLE community digs on, and I am in my element!    CONS:  Maybe a wee bit expensive, but it&#39;s worth though!  
                  Located in a cafeteria in a less crowded part of downtown San Jose, on an alleyway so it&#39;s clear of traffic, parking was pretty easy since its in a block with 2 hour parking all along the sides.  Our order: Konjoe burger without the jalapeños, and the pepper jack cheese replaced with cheddar (I&#39;m weak, sorry ) The Basics Burger Pork baos An order of fries which you get to choose a sauce with so we chose the Konjoe sauce and ranch sauce  I was afraid the order would take long because when we ordered an old lady came up and told one of the workers she had been waiting for fifteen minutes, but our order came out pretty quickly.  The sweet bread they use for their burgers makes the burgers super delicious. I didn&#39;t get to try their pork baos but my parents said they were delicious but a tad spicy, the meat was soft but there was a lot of fat on them. The fries were seasoned well and went great with the Konjoe and ranch sauce.  The most impressive thing that I found with Konjoe was that the burger was pretty light, most burgers are uncomfortably heavy for me, but I was able to finish the burger and leave with a happy tummy.  
                  As someone who&#39;s never super impressed with burgers, the Konjoe burger is one of the best burgers I&#39;ve ever had! The meat was perfectly cooked, the fried egg had a nice runny yolk, the jalapeños added a spicy kick with all the fixings! This is my go-to meal when I&#39;m at San Pedro Square Market. Pair it with some alcohol/fresh lemonade and fries and you got a perfect sports game meal!  
                  This is the probably the most popular food place in the San Pedro Marketplace and with good reason. I haven&#39;t ordered a burger yet but I do always get their Pork Baos which are pork belly in steamed buns. They are excellent!!! Slightly on the pricey side ($11 for 3 buns) and not as filling as the burgers but still a great dish. None of the orders come with a side of fries so you have to get them separately but they are good too.   I didn&#39;t give this place 5 stars because of parking. It is the most popular place and gets so much business BUT it is one of the only places that doesn&#39;t offer parking validation!!! That is ridiculous. The least the company could do is give their loyal customers free parking.  
                  Nom nom nom...pork belly sandwich and baos...nom nom nom, all up in my tummy!  The baos lived up to the hype - thick cuts, juicy, flavorful with the thin pickled apple slices on top and drenched in sauce. I would say I wish they used a little less sauce (on the pork belly sandwich too) so I can taste the pork belly more, but that&#39;s just a personal preference.   Good amount of pork belly in the sandwich too. And don&#39;t be fooled by the &#34;sandwich&#34; vs. &#34;burger&#34;. If you look at my photos, it&#39;s the same buns as my friend&#39;s konjoe burger which he enjoyed just as much. Again, very saucey. There will be a pool of sauce in your burger wrapper at the end.  The white peach lemonade was good but VERY sweet. I wouldn&#39;t mind doing half-2/3 the lemonade and other part water. But if you&#39;re a sweet tooth, you&#39;ll love it.  Tl;dr Recommend the pork belly baos and sandwich. White peach lemonade is really sweet.  
                  Meh. Not the special burgers they used to be. Hopefully not the trend here now. Medium rare was medium well (zero pink, not very juicy), small amount of shredded lettuce instead of the leafy butter lettuce, and zero kick to the once-spicy Konjoe sauce. (This stuff was pretty spicy when they first opened and is now like in n out sauce.)  Fries were fresh and perfect crispness but a bit over seasoned. Not a bad meal, but not exceptional as they used to be. Will try again, hoping for better.  
                  If you happen to be in San Pedro Market this is the food to try. The burgers are great. My favourite drink: raspberry lemonade. I love the ambient in the market. The reason I am not giving a full five star is because the burger was a bit greasy.  
                  This place has some yummy food choices but I hesitate to give it 5 stars because of the slow service. We like their fries- covered in some spicy salts-delicious! My husband loves the chicken and waffles but they always seem to take a crazy long time to be ready. The burgers are good and flavorful with unexpected ingredients. Check them out!!  
                  I&#39;m only bitter that the burger is a bit expensive, limiting my intake.   Put out a burger/fries/beer deal and take more of my money guys. I know I know, I can get a beer anywhere I want at San Pedro, but if I could have the holy trinity mentioned above with one swipe of my card, not 2 swipes, one single, elegant swipe, I would be here more often. Even if it&#39;s cheap beer, I like that too. Yes I&#39;m that lazy.  
                  mm, best burger ive had in awhile. it was the only place in the food court with that many people waiting to order, so i fell in line :) it took like a million hours to finally get my buger and the wait was a pain but it really was worth it when i got my hands wrapped around that juuuicy burger (prepare to get messy and your hands drenched in it). the fries weren&#39;t that great and the spicy ketchup was also nothing special.. Want to try their lemonade drank next time :)  
                  What took me so long? The drive was definitely worth it! Burger game is served.  I&#39;m not big on burgers and fries but changed my mind after trying Konjoe. Tucked away in the Public Market  in San Jose with a unique fast food burger menu, you can&#39;t beat it.  I had the Pulled Pork Burger and my friend tried the must try Konjoe Burger. I mean, a burger with an egg that all just melts in your mouth you can&#39;t help but want another one to go. Lol. The Pulled Pork was my favorite because it had that yummy BBQ flavor or smoked bacon with this slice of something pickled.  Also tried the Chicken and Waffles. The seasoning on the chicken was off the chain. The waffles tasted like fluffy fried donut mix. You gotta order it.   Service was great and so were the prices. Can&#39;t wait to go back!  
                  I was wandering around all the food stands debating between the ribs next door, and the pork belly here.  Judging by the line and all the people chatting about the pork belly, I decided to be a follower and buy the pork belly.  Great juicy and decently fatty sandwich. It reminds me of Chairman Bao&#39;s pork belly but on a much bigger scale, and in sandwich form.  Can&#39;t say that it was 5 star amazing, but it was above average, hence the 4 stars.  
                  As salivating as the pork belly photos were I was craving an actual burger.   I got the Kalbi Burger + egg. The toppings were good but used pretty sparingly. I&#39;m not sure how they marinate the burger, if even but the actual patty itself was lacking flavor. The kalbi little salty but not too much where it ruined any flavor for me...but it was suuuuper watery! This was the messiest burger I&#39;ve probably had, my first bite their watery sauce squirted out hellla far! I defiantly got sauce all over my hands and on my legs just from that first bite. Make sure you have plenty of napkins for this one!  If the sauce was better it totally would have been worth it (wan&#39;t a big deal though).   My boyfriend got the Konjoe Burger. His was pretty good (liked mine more) but we both agree&#39;d that it was missing something...I think that it needed some more acidity and he wasn&#39;t sure what it was =p Their konjoe sauce seemed pretty non existent, maybe ask for extra on the side.  I personally liked their sweet bun. It was moist and very light. My boyfriend personally doesn&#39;t like sweet buns but that is their only option so if you&#39;re like him it might ruin the burger a little for you (maybe go protein style?)..  This place was pretty good, probably more deserving of 3.5 stars. If their patties and kalbi sauce tasted better this place would be better =p  
                  The burger speaks for it self. Eat one and you well know why this place is highly rated. Definitely a place to try if you&#39;re in San Jose.  
                  I love this place! The pork belly burger is so good! It melts in your mouth! The pork belly is perfectly cooked. You have the option of adding jalapeños and a fried egg too! I haven&#39;t tried the other options here. But I&#39;m sure they are good as well! Can&#39;t wait to go back again!  
                  Love this place! My go-to when I&#39;m craving friend chicken. It comes with waffles which are alright, but the chicken.. Yummmm! I also love their pork belly baos.. They are a must try of you haven&#39;t had them already. Their burgers are delicious too. I&#39;ve had the one with the egg and also added a slab of pork belly. I was indulging, and it was worth all the calories. Mmm now I want that just thinking about it  
                  First time here and the food is amazing! Plus service was spot on! The cashier, who did the register and also  gave the food at the counter was on her game. She looked happy and did everything in a timely matter. I got the konjoe burger and it tasted like the primetime at this burger joint in austin (totally forgot the name of it). Fries aren&#39;t that great. Definitely coming back for that burger!  
                  Juicy, filling, cooked to perfection. That&#39;s all I can say, one of the best burgers I&#39;ve had in my life and I don&#39;t really like burgers....  
                  I had this place bookmarked for some reason. But we were having a few drinks at the San Pedro Market and I decided I needed food. Luckily the name looked familiar and their options looked good. I ordered the pork belly burger and fries. Then they give you one of those light up and vibrating pagers so you know when your food&#39;s ready. It took about 10 minutes for my food to be ready. The burger was great. The pork belly was flavored well and pretty fatty. I liked the sauces and the lettuce, apple slaw. The fries are like almost Belgium style. It was also a good amount of fries so don&#39;t be shy about sharing. It&#39;s great food overall but while drinking, it&#39;s extra good.  
                  These burgers are really different. I&#39;m a fan of savory flavored so Konjoe hits the spot for me. They have great seasoned fries a variety of house made sauces that you can choose from. I personally recommend the RGST Mayo! Also, they offer parking validation!  
                  Ok, I gave their burgers a solid 4 stars because they are quite flavorful and juicy. However, now that they have pork belly buns (not to be mistaken for the pork belly burger), those are actually my go to as they are some of the best baos I&#39;ve had.   I noticed they also added a fried chicken and waffles dish. The fried chicken is on point but the waffle could use a bit of work. For now, they are reminiscent of soggy Eggo waffles.  
                  Great burgers!  In the rear part of the San Pedro Square Market, the selection was great and the food was top notch.  I had the Konjoe Burger.  With beef, lettuce, fried egg, caramelized onions, pickled jalapeños, cheese and konjoe sauce I was concerned the jalapeños might be too hot but instead it was a perfect balance of flavors.   My friend enjoyed the Fried Chicken and Waffles and promised it was as good as it looked.    Often I find one thing at a restaurant and I will go back just for that and this burger would easily tempt me back, but there was a pretty decent selection of food and I actually would like to try a few other things before I settle.  At any rate, I am definitely a fan, can&#39;t wait to go back.  
                  Hey hey hey!  Who&#39;s got the best burger in the South Bay?  Konjoe does!  When craving a juicy, well cooked, perfectly seasoned burger, Konjoe definitely satisfies.    Every burger I have tried has been delicious in it&#39;s own way.  I&#39;ve sampled the basic, the Konjoe, and the Kalbi.  I&#39;m working my way down their menu and the Kalbi is my current favorite.  Such a great blend of american burger-y-ness with Korean flavors, all on top of a sweet (literally) bun.  Their fries are also well seasoned.    They use quality ingredients and take pride in the presentation of their food.  Each burger is its own masterpiece.  Located in San Pedro Square Market, across from TreatBot, in the other building.  
                  Dear Konjoe Burger,  Why are you so good? This place is one of my favorite burger joints beside the counter. I am in love with their Kalbi burger with an egg for $12.50! Their burger is really juicy and it&#39;s in a perfect bun. The burger took about 15 minutes to come out. Every bite I took, I can literally taste all of the texture and how juicy the burger is. I also like their cajun fries! Freshly seasoned and their konjoe sauce though..  
                  The Konjoe burger is quite good. The spicy mayo sauce that you can choose to dip your fries with is delicious. The wait in line and for the food to arrive wasn&#39;t too long. Prices is a bit more higher, but the portion of the burger us big.  
                  What&#39;s not to like about a korean inspired burger joint? My favorites are the kalbi burger, shitake jack, and pork belly sandwich. Don&#39;t forget their fries...yum! Just go there and try every thing kn the menu, it is delish!!!!!!!!!!  
                  Amazing service and food. Burgers are full of flavor and the fries are freshly seasoned to perfection. Definitely going to be back here for more!  
                  Can you say &#34;Sheeee tok-eeeeeh?!&#34;  Well, you can try saying it the other way (s*** tok-eeh) but let&#39;s keep the profanities out of this.  If you&#39;re wondering what I&#39;m talking about, it&#39;s the only burger I&#39;ve ever ordered here.  You ready for it?  Here we go:  *Shiitake Jack: beef, lettuce, pickled jalapenos, shiitake mushrooms, jack cheese, r.g.s.t aioli.  This is the only burger to get here at San Pedro Square.  It is the juiciest, most tasty, and mouth watering burger *ever*. The beauty of this burger is that it&#39;s a simple formula.  Beef+jack cheese+mushrooms.  Everything else is icing on the cake.   If you don&#39;t believe me, try it for yourself.    *Hand cut fries:  Fried goodness.  That is all.  
                  I&#39;ve back recently, and Konjoe has the longest line in that square right now...(implies quite a wait).   Since then, I&#39;ve been ordering Konjoe burger because I love having an egg, but I just tried Pork belly today and woah! Sorry Konjoe burger, you are bumping off my top one list! The sauce of Pork belly burger is really amazing--! Sweet and spicy with a kick, fit well with the pickled apple, and also moderate the fat and oiliness of the pork belly.  
                  The location is inside San pedro market. Not sure about validation but we parked outside. I&#39;m not a burger kind of girl but it was quite tasty.  The patties were juice and cook correctly as I order,  medium rare.  Fries were alright.  Fries are ordered separately. Burger size is normal.  
                  Love this burger place! Whenever I&#39;m downtown or just craving a good burger this is the the first place I would always pick to go. Already looking forward to the next time I go back.  
                  My family and I tried this place because my brother&#39;s fraternity brother&#39;s friend is the chef and owner :)  Yes it is pricey (about $8-$11 or more) but it&#39;s a great try I think.   I got the Kalbi Burger while my brother got the Konjoe Burger. Both us devoured our burgers. The patty isn&#39;t frozen, it&#39;s made and mixed with ingredients. It makes the burger so juicy. The lettuce is so fresh and green.  
                  Stopped here for a burger and fries for dinner before trivia.  There aren&#39;t a million choices here (a good thing in my view), but you should be more than able to find something that&#39;ll do ya&#39;.  I had the Konjoe burger, which was a pretty standard offering save for the fried egg and pickled jalapenos.  While cooked past my requested mid-rare, it was still plenty tender and tasty.  I also got an order of fries which were fine.  If you want any sauce with your fries, make sure to request it, because they won&#39;t ask you (or at least, they didn&#39;t ask me).  Don&#39;t expect fast food prices or quickness here...you&#39;ll likely shell out near $15 for a burger and fries, and you&#39;ll probably wait at least 10-15 minutes.  But I think you&#39;ll get something good for your trouble, so try it out.  
                  Tasty burgers! Atmosphere likes in some european markets where you can buy and eat nice food  
                  Great burgers and good service.   I&#39;ve been here several times with friends (a must-stop for one friend whenever he&#39;s back in town). It&#39;s located in the up and coming San Pedro Market Square (Building 2) near the Beer Market and Bray BBQ. My go-to order is the Konjoe Burger (b/c who can say no to jalapenos and an egg *drools*). My friends love the Pork Belly Sandwich (I personally like the burger more). The pork belly is seasoned and cooked perfectly, but I think the bread is a little too much for the pork belly. I probably would prefer the Pork Belly Bao (need to try in the future). Fries are seasoned and cooked to perfection. The konjoe sauce consistency has sometimes been too watery for my liking. I haven&#39;t gotten to try the other sauces yet (there&#39;s so many choices and who can say no to the signature sauce), but it does go well with ketchup too. I have tried the fried chicken and waffle there and yums! LOVE!   Overall, great place for burgers or even fried chicken. Grab a beer or drink nearby and you&#39;ve got yourself the perfect meal. Highly recommended.  
                  It&#39;s like the makers of Konjoe Burger have mastered how much food to give you without destroying your appetite for the next couple days. The size of their burgers are larger than the yelp pictures appear.  The Konjoe burger was $12.50 of meat patty orgasm. The amount of fries they give seems inconsistent. They just seem to squeeze however much they can into the given basket space. Regardless, they came out crispy, salty, and crunchy. Thank goodness I didn&#39;t get that much fries, because that burger I already had finished by now has made me looked pregnant.  
                  Got the Konjoe burger and order of fries here for the first time today after eyeing it for the last few times I was in San Pedro Square. The staff member who took my order was very friendly and gave great service.  The burger and fries took awhile (about 10 minutes) but the guy who took my order was nice enough to offer some water while I waited. The flavor of the burger itself was pretty good! It came with a fried egg, cheese, lettuce, and jalapeños. The patty was also medium rare just like how I asked. Points for that! However, the bun itself isn&#39;t very good and was very slippery; the entire burger fell apart a bit and the over-medium egg definitely added to the mess. Nevertheless, it was fun to eat and definitely tasted good.  The fries, on the other hand, were fantastic. Super crispy and the seasoning was great. It looked and tasted a bit like cajun seasoning but I can&#39;t put my finger on what it was exactly. Whatever it was, it was good! I&#39;d want to try other new things in San Pedro Square first, but I can definitely see myself returning this joint!  
                  I&#39;ve been here twice and love the quality of their burgers. The location is inside the San Pedro Market where Blush is located. They don&#39;t carry the normal burgers here but have different selections such as the Kalbi and Pork Belly, they&#39;re fries are good too. Ask them for the Konjoe sauce to dip your fries in.   The only thing with this place that I have to comment on is that you got to eat fast! The patty is super juicy and the bread soaks it all in, so if you don&#39;t want a soggy burger nom nom nom away! Great quality!  
                  Pork belly wow!  I came to Konjoe Burger Bar for their pork belly sandwich and pork belly bao. The way that they prepare the pork belly makes it very tender and tasty to it. Combine it with their bun or bao, even better! What a good sandwich/bao they make.  
                  It&#39;s good, definitely, but a little pricey. Especially after all the extra toppings :( I just got the regular cheeseburger, because everything else sounded a little too heavy on my arteries. I added mushrooms with my burger and that costed a bit extra. When it came out, I asked them where the mushrooms were and I think they said they just cooked it with the meat. So it was just one big thing of meat/shroom. The burger itself was good, but not omg this is the best burger I&#39;ve ever had good. The fries were seasoned with some deliciousness and I can&#39;t seem to put my finger on it. However the fries were thick, which were not to my liking, personally. I would probably come back if I were in the area! But spending that much on a burger turns me away just a bit :(  
                  This is your Asian-American (founder is of Japanese descent - to be exact) run local burger joint. The fried egg slipped inside the burger had me intrigued. Their simple, block-colored pictographic menu on the wall describes each selection every clearly and will have you salivating for one.  The wait for the burger was longer than expected. Almost 20 minutes for an order of Konjoe burger (inside, fried egg, lettuce, onions, jalapenos, choice of cheddar or jack cheese) with seasoned fries on the side - #1 item on the menu. I&#39;m not sure if this is usual, so I&#39;d read other Yelpers&#39; reviews before making conclusion.  Pros - They asked how would you like your burger? And, medium rare is legit medium rare. Tender and juicy. Delicious and serious business.  Cons - Bun was too soft - so soft that beef and everything else in between the buns fell off. It was quite a juicy mess. I personally would like the bun to be more toasty. Fries were too soggy for my taste.  
                  Been here a couple times. Not your typical burger joint, its got sort of an asian twist to it. Portions are decent, but prices are a bit high. They always take a while to make your food, but they give you a buzzer.   1. Pork belly baos - must try, I come just for these. Comes with 3 scrumptious small baos. The pork belly is made perfectly and that sauce is hella good. They ran out of this 2 times i tried to get it so don&#39;t wait till near closing time to try and order this. 2. Konjoe and Shiitake burgers - they are both just ok since they overcooked the patties, but if cooked perfectly they would have been good 3. Fries - their ok  
                  Such a good burger. I&#39;ve gone here twice now. 1st time I ordered their pork belly steamed buns. It was good, but not worth the price for 2 small steamed buns, it didn&#39;t even come with fries. At the time I was wishing I had a burger instead.   2nd time around I had their Shiitake Jack burger and added grilled onions. Shiitake jack comes with lettuce, pickled jalapenos, shiitake mushrooms, jack cheese, and aioli sauce. Ordered my burger medium well, it was cooked perfectly. Grilled bun, good amount of toppings, and juicy patty. Seasoned fries were crispy and the seasoning had a spicy kick.   Burgers are a little pricy, but do come with fries. I&#39;m more than happy to pay more for a quality burger like this.   During the weekend there can be a bit of a wait, even if the line doesn&#39;t look long when you order there could have been plenty of people before. We waited about 35min for our order.   Konjoe Burger Bar is located at San Pedro Square so parking can also be a challenge.  
                  Last night my wife and I each had the Kalbi burger w/ added grilled onions. The burger is in the top five burgers I&#39;ve ever had. Delicious. Would have given five stars, but the girl working the register was just not... nice. She didn&#39;t go out of her way to be rude, but she acted like she could have cared less about being there. That her having to take our order was a bother. Made us a bit uncomfortable.   The thing that sucks about the various vendors at San Pedro Square market, is they give you the option to give a gratuity as you place your order. For what? You&#39;re not waiting on us, you&#39;re taking an order. If you&#39;re waiting on us at a table is one thing, but taking a simple order for two burgers is another. We tipped this unpleasant worker, as we were taken aback by the gratuity request. We just tipped without giving much thought. As we discussed the entire order dialog later, we thought, why did we tip her? She wasn&#39;t even nice...  We&#39;ll be back, the burgers are out of this world. Hopefully next time we&#39;ll get an employee that seems happy to be employed.  
                  Came here before a Sharks game. Might imagine it&#39;s tough doing business next to a BBQ joint but they hold their own with their kickass burgers!  First of all, points for grassfed, single origin ground beef. Grassfed ground beef is super healthy, flavorful, and environmentally responsible. When you source it from a single farm, you don&#39;t have to worry about imported beef or mixed sources, etc. thanks for offering this, Konjoe.   Second, fries were super on point. Hand cut. Not frozen. So delicious!!  Third, lots of custom options, toppings, and sauces. I can make a great burger at home. I&#39;m glad they offer plenty of options for me to customize it many ways into something I might not normally try or have on hand.   Last, service was superb. Very pleased at how friendly they were even on a busy night.  
                  Let me tell you, this place can get busy but it&#39;s worth it! They have a variety of grass fed beef. Super yummy. The bun is crispy enough on the outside and then when you bite into the meat it&#39;s super juicy! The flavor all together are simply amazing. Most come with seasoned fries and they&#39;re delightful as well. They have different flavors of lemonade depending on the day. The staff is nice and helpful if it&#39;s your first time ordering there. I will of course be coming back for more!  
                  Is another review going to justify this place?  Sure, why the heck not.  Burgers, for better or worse, are the next the hipster food trend after the cupcake.  Not that I&#39;ll go outta my way for a cupcake. But I would go outta my way for a burger here.  Asian-hipster burger happiness happens begins with the basics.  That&#39;s what its called.  Baseline meat, cheese, bun and some produce.  Protein is cooked to order.  Mine is medium rare and that&#39;s what I got.  Now here&#39;s the thing.  If you&#39;re going to spend 10.00 bones on a burger, do yourself a favor and eat it there.  Taking it home or back to the office just doesn&#39;t do it.  The first collateral damage were the fries.  Although tasty with whatever they&#39;re sprinkled with (a cayene something or other), they were gummy instead of crispy.  My bad.  The burger faired better.  A delightful puck of beef cooked to order atop of greens and tomatoe between brioche like bunnage.    There&#39;s other interesting stuff like bao and chicken and waffles.  The special during my visit was cracklings.    Got my attention.  
                  Good burger place. I personally like it more than the counter~I like pork belly and I like steamed buns, so this new product of pork belly with steamed buns is very attractive to me!  
                  I&#39;ve been wanting to try Konjoe for a couple of months now. When I saw Little Chef Counter&#39;s closure on Friday, I decided to swing by and order a burger.  Service was definitely slow, especially with a small line. I forget the name of the burger I ended up going with, but it came with cucumbers and a special mayo-based sauce.   My order was ready in 15 minutes. The pagers were a nice added convenience inside the busy San Pedro Marketplace.  The burger was good, but nothing special. The cucumbers added a unique fresh element to the dish. The bun seemed tasty initially, but it became soggy rather quickly. The burger was also slightly undercooked.  Overall, a decent experience  but not worth the hype.  
                  Very clean kitchen and amazingly delicious combination of unique ingredients!   Definitely recommend to anyone who&#39;s looking for an awesomely unique burgers!   Open kitchens are great because it can help you see whether you should try it or walk away. Konjoe has a super clean kitchen so I was so excited to try the pork belly.   The pork belly steamed buns are worth a try, I&#39;ve never had pickled apples but it was surprisingly yummy and matched better than other common ingredients like cucumbers. The pork is cooked perfectly with a crispy outside and soft inside. The Chinese bbq and spicy chili garlic sauce really tied the flavors in nicely.   They also use the best buns for their burgers and the fries are better than most places I&#39;ve tried.   Go try it now!  
                  Help.  I am suffering from post pork belly bao cravings.  Lusciously griddled fall apart savory heaven melting in soft deliciousness, that envelops your mouth with flavor, spiked with green onions and spicy hoisin sauce all brought together with the sweet fluffy bao dough.  I got it for a quick bite to eat in a working lunch, and I was having trouble concentrating on what my work mates were saying the experience was so transporting.  Go.  You will love it.  Really first rate flavors melded into comfort happiness.  
                  For a $15 burger w/tip...I expected more than just an average messy burger. I ordered the konjoe burger, the first one on the menu. I think maybe other yelpers hyped it up too much, but my burger was not at all amazing!!  I wouldn&#39;t want to spend that money on a burger, but I think their other options would be better. Overall, I would give it another shot, but I was not sold this time!  
                  An the Konjoe Burger was absolutely incredible. It was quality meat cooked a perfectly juicy medium rare topped with an over easy egg, mild jalapeños, and a house sauce. Not to mention the house fries were absolutely perfect as well. Definitely recommended for anyone looking for a burger fix when they&#39;re in the San Pedro Square Market.  
                  San Jose, you surprised me with your Asian fusion swag.   Split the Kalbi burger and pork belly buns. Both were solid but I think my inner Roy Choi wanted a bit more caramelization on the pork belly.   They kindly cut our burger in half for us, which shows that there&#39;s heart behind that hipster somewhere.  
                  My favorite burger in San Jose. Love the egg and the jalapeños. Every time I come to the market I look around, but always come back here. Great job with those burgers Konjoe!  
                  I&#39;ve been here three times, and I&#39;ve left satisfied all three times.   The only thing I order is the PORK BELLY BURGER. And before going here, I never ate pork belly. My life was changed forever after this.  But ombbbb I can&#39;t stress enough how amazing this menu item is. Especially when you add a fried egg on top and the yolk oozes out when you take a bite. LOVE IT!   The buns come out semi crisp and semi soft with a layer of lettuce and then the pork belly which is soft and tender but juicy at the same time. It comes with a side of seasoned fries which are delicious when you dip them in the garlic aoli sauce (ordered on the side, and also good with the burger!).   Its located in the building with Blush in the San Pedro Market. Usually gets pretty crowded for dinner, but that pork belly is worth the wait.  ** If you&#39;re going to share (sometimes I have to because it&#39;s pretty filling), ask them to cut it in half when you order so that the burger and yolk don&#39;t get too messy for you to handle. **  
                  Honestly the burgers here look better than they taste. That&#39;s what attracted the bf and I to come here. They&#39;re big and filling, but personally the bf and I prefer Smashburger and in n out burgers taste wise. It didn&#39;t strike us as anything too special.  I got the pork belly sandwich while the bf ended up ordering the konjoe Jack burger. The pork belly sandwich is supposedly one of the popular items here but when I tasted it, it was just okay at best. I&#39;ve definitely had my fair share of delicious pork belly. The bf said his burger was just alright and he wanted his burger craving to be redempted at Smashburger.  Pricewise, these burgers are also more expensive than Red Robins. Expect to spend at least $12 a person when you come here.  Eh, no thanks, Konjoe. I&#39;ll pass.  
                  After a year of dodging this place for some reason, I finally ate here on a dinner trip to San Pedro.  I&#39;ve eaten at almost all of the places in San Pedro Market, and this one is up there, maybe top 5.  The biggest downside however is the price.    Food: So I got the pork belly sandwich which comes with fries.  I added an egg as well since I was hungry.  And had to get a drink so I got the white peach lemonade.  The sandwich itself was great, it had a pretty substantial piece of pork belly and went really well with the buns they use.  I would&#39;ve passed on the egg knowing that it&#39;d be fully cooked.  I was hoping that the egg&#39;s yolk would have at least oozed a bit, but it didn&#39;t...  The egg is pretty pricey at $1.25 extra for what was just a sunny side up egg.  Their fries are pretty good, especially when paired with their variety of sauces.  The peach lemonade was basically all lemonade flavor.  I had a sense that it would be as lemonade would easily power over peach, but I was hoping it wasn&#39;t the case.  It wasn&#39;t worth the price.    The service was ok.  The cashier seemed like he was absent-minded.  Almost ended up with the wrong drink and forgot I hadn&#39;t even gotten it in the first place.  Overall, my total came out to ~$17-18 which I thought was somewhat pricey for what I got.  Their burger and fries are great, but it&#39;s somewhat pricier compared to other food joints in San Pedro.  
                  Their konjoe burger is just aiteeeee but have u had their pork belly burger ohhhh n add a sunny side egg on top! So delishhhhhhhh... Would def give them a 5 but the girl at the register is sorta rude  
                  Delicious pork baos! I&#39;ve ordered this heavenly creation twice so far. The combination of pork belly, pickled Asian pear, and bao are amazing in taste and texture.   On my third visit, I ordered the konjoe burger with a helping of pork belly as recommended by one of the cooks working the grill. Supposedly that was the most delicious and fastest thing they could make.  The quality is great, but it does take quiet se time for the food to be ready. Being as it is in a food court-ish location, I think they could be more efficient with time and flow. My burger took around 20 minutes to make. It was delicious and messy...as most burgers usually are. I also would wish the buns weren&#39;t so soggy with all the juices coming down. Welp! The flavors were very well done and that&#39;s a minor tweak that could be fixed.  I&#39;d be back for more especially for that aioli dipping sauce I had with my friends! I highly recommend it! Support local!  
                  I always love this place. The konjoe burger is delicious. Add an egg to that already scrumptious burger and you have magic. I took my friends here from out of town and they also loved it. Definitely recommend it as one of the top places in San Pedro Square. Grab a beer while you wait and you won&#39;t be disappointed.  
                  One of the ups and downs to traveling is when you discover deliciously awesome places like Konjoe burger.  Konjoe burger is located inside the San Pedro Square market, which is a super cool food court looking place.  There looks to be a lot of good food selections at the market and there is plenty of seating.    First glance, definitely an Asian fusion.  There are signs letting you know that their meat is grass fed and hormone and antibiotics free!  I got the Konjoe burger which comes with beef, which I got medium rare, lettuce, caramelized onions, a fried egg, lettuce, cheese, picked jalapeños and Konjoe sauce.  It also came with a side of seasoned fries.  They give you a little pager thing that buzzed when your food is ready.  The food came out pretty quickly maybe like around 5 minutes or so.   The burger and fries looked delicious.  Their fries were so good!  I love the seasoning and they were nice and crisp.  I got the burger with no cheese and the pickled jalapeños on the side.   For some reason those pickled jalapeños tasted way better than jalapeños from any other place.  I was eating them with my fries and it tasted so good.  I eventually ended up dumping my jalapeños back into the burger.    The burger was delicious!  The sauce, egg, jalapeños and meat went together perfectly on a nice and puffy bun.  My only complaint was that eating the burger got ridiculously messy.  I punctured the yolk of the fried egg and it leaked everywhere.  The bun soaked up most of the yolk however trying to eat a burger with a yolk soaked bun is extremely difficult.  I gave up trying to eat it like a proper lady and just devoured the thing.  I have no regrets.  4 stars just because the whole messy bun situation was really irritating but other than that, super good burger.  If I lived closer I would totally come back here all the time but sadly I do not.  Well, on the bright side.  I now have more of a reason to look forward to heading to San Jose!  I cannot wait to come back and try more on their menu!  
                  Honestly, I can&#39;t really justify spending like $13 for a burger and fries BUT I&#39;ll let it slide Konjoe... Just this once or maybe for like ever.  I got the konjoe burger and it was G-L-O-R-I-O-U-S!!  The patty was moist and packed with delicious flavor.  Nothing was overpowering, just floating on a bun in perfect harmony.  I&#39;m getting hungry writing this review.. Not to mention, the bun was like a metaphorical high five.  It was like a hawaiian roll, but bun form. F@ck yeah!  Also, there was a fried egg... Yolky, yellow goodness oozing everywhere.  Food porn at it&#39;s finest.  Do it.  
                  Came here on a Friday night anticipating to try the Pork Belly Burger. Unfortunately upon my arrival, they ran out of the Pork Belly and I had to order something else. Sad life. :( Definitely need to try it next time!  My boyfriend and I ordered the Konjoe and Galbi burger. Both were delicious and juicy. The Konjoe Burger came with a fried egg which was a wonderful addition to my entree! I also really loved the Aioli sauce and yummy pickles that came with the entrees. It definitely exceeded my recommendations! I highly recommend both burgers!  The fries that accommodated the burgers were also delicious and tasted really similar to Maui Onion Chips! Yum  Con: Girl working the cashier was a bit rude and it looked like she didn&#39;t want to be there. When I asked her what exactly was in the Konjoe Burger, she literally asked me &#34;what do you mean what&#39;s in the Konjoe Burger? Why don&#39;t you look at the menu to find out?&#34;. Lol, so much attitude and really rude.  
                  Konjoe stepped up their burger game since it&#39;s opening concept!  Burgers are altogether larger (look at old pics versus newer pics), so much better meeting the expectations of a $10-$14 price tag, and are complimented by hand-cut fries, replacing the chips (which were decent, but felt more like a novelty than a proper side).   Output still hits the occasional speedbump, though. On average nights, we (3) have waited 10-15 minutes for an order to be ready (two porkbelly, one konjoe), but I&#39;ve also waited upward of 35 minutes for a single burger during one of SPSM&#39;s busier/event days - the cashier was forthright while I was ordering, letting me know that they were slammed and it would take about 25 minutes. I appreciated the honesty/effort. SPSM can be a madhouse sometimes, it must be hard to scale/keep up on days like that.  Thankfully customer service has always been excellent and continues to be courteous and friendly, full of young hustle. I&#39;m glad; konjoe seem to be enjoying success. __________________ Porkbelly, yo. Porkbelly.  
                  burgers are amazing. a little pricey considering the fact that it&#39;s not a sit down style restaurant. Look to spend about 15 per person  
                  Definitely a unique burger shop. And in my opinion better than Unami.   You can tell everything is fresh and organic. A solid choice if you are looking for a good bite in downtown SJ.  -1 star because the burgers take a while, and it is pretty $$.  
                  I made my San Pedro debut a couple weeks ago and was very pleased with my experience at Konjoe Burger. I was in the mood for a no-frills burger so I went with the Basic, which comes with your choice of cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and Konjoe sauce and a side of their homemade fries.   My burger was very juicy and tender with a healthy slap of their signature Konjoe sauce. All the ingredients were well portioned and well balanced. At first bite, I knew this was a burger comprised of some high quality ingredients. The house made sauces and high-quality locally grown meats and produce are the hallmarks of Konjoe Burger. You can assure you will be getting one fresh burger here and supporting the local food movement.   The driving force behind Konjoe is Joey Camacho, whose strong culinary arts background in Hawaii, Guam and California have lent his cooking style a delicious Asian touch. There are some creative burgers like the Kalbi, which comes with beef, kimchee, cucumbers and sesame aioli; the Pork Belly features slow-roasted pork belly, pickled apples, hoisin ketchup sambal and aioli.   Konjoe serves up some tasty burgers with a focus on fresh and wholesome. I would like to get back to Konjoe Burger and try one of their specially burgers.  
                  San Pedro Square is full of pleasant food options, and the Konjoe Burger Bar is one of them! I wanted to take my sister and a friend of mine out for dinner before drinks, so we decided to check out Konjoe! They have a small but interesting menu to offer, and I&#39;ve been itching to try their pork belly burger!  Their pork belly burger came with the side of fries! The seasoned fries were freshly made and delicious! The pork belly on the other hand was really oily! But the burger over all was good... The burger bun wasn&#39;t too bad either! My friend who ordered the Kalbi burger also enjoyed hers.   Overall, Good burgers but we all thought it was pretty pricey. For three burgers w/ fries, the total came out to almost $40!  
                  If any burger you&#39;ve had ever lied to you, then a Konjoe Burger will set you free from all lies!  Since my last visit to SPSM, I notice that Konjoe is a new business that appeared out of the blue. I&#39;ve heard many good things about this place, and it was the time for me to actually try this mystical burger spot. I was so overwhelmed with the burger choices, (Basic, Konjoe, Pork Belly, Kalbi, ex.), but I was advised by my bro in law to go with the Konjoe burger.  I decided to treat my bro in law and cousin with some burgers. There was no line formed and that&#39;s when I knew I had to make my move. I ended up ordering 3 burgers, 2 Konjoes and 1 Pork belly. After placing the order, the final financial damage was close to a whopping $40 tab for 3 burgers! I received the popular pager used by many restaurants to notify me when my order was done.   Ten to fifteen minutes later, my pager buzzed and I proceeded to pick up our burgers. Before leaving the counter with the burgers, we had choices of special sauces to accompany our burgers. I picked the spicy ketchup because I like ketchup and spicy!  I just had to stare at my burger for awhile to see what physical features makes this burger worth $13. For me it wasn&#39;t visible on the outside, but was exposed when I took my first bite. The beef patty was cooked to a medium, but tasted like it was medium rare, the way I like my meat, pause! Fresh lettuce, pickled jalapenos, and caramelized onions composed the veggie medley in the burger.  And to make the burger extravagant, a fried egg,  melted jack cheese, and soft burger buns laced with konjoe sauce. Everything just paired together flawlessly! This order came with fries and tasted great as well. I wasn&#39;t really thrilled with the spicy ketchup, but my main focus was on how darn good that burger tasted!  I took a sample of my bro in law&#39;s burger, the pork belly, and for sure that&#39;s is my next conquest!  Unlike other burger spots where you pay for quantity vs quality, it&#39;s vice versa  here. Quality over quantity!  
                  Today (see: 2 days ago) I got my husband to have a burger at konjoe.   After boasting about my experiences having their basics and konjoe burg, he went with the Kalbi burger. The burgers are juicy but messy. The buns don&#39;t hold up well to the juices put out by the patty and condiments. I may opt to try the bao buns next time.  
                  Love this place!!! First time here and took the entire family, and inlaws. A little mix up with the order but they promptly took care of us.   The Konjoe Burger was amazing!!!! Put bacon and an egg on it!!! Yum!!!!!  Will definitely be back. It also helps that there&#39;s a place just infront of Konjoe to grabs cold beer and enjoy!!!!
