                  I love love love their different flavors! Horchata and this Lavender Honey are my favorite  Horchata- If you do not know what horchata is then you live under a rock and I do not wish to explain  Lavender Honey- I will compare this flavor to green tea ice cream :)) Fave!!!  
                  I really wanted ice cream and Jimbos was closed down the way, next best thing... Treatbot!  The ice cream was quite tasty, our favorites were the 408 and The Mountain (chromatic coffee flavor) both of which were creamy and flavored quite subtly. I personally was not a fan of the horchata flavor however. It left a slickness on the tongue like milk I really disliked.  The service during the visit fantastic and friendly and I would probably come back even though Treatbot wouldn&#39;t be one of my top three (Bi-Rite,Willow Glen Creamery, Jimbos) for the Bay Area.  I will say I&#39;ve been to San Pedro Square quite a bit and while I&#39;m not an ice cream girl the Treatbot section is a bit... cluttered? It really does look like an alley, or a messy street with the boxes not all the way under the truck. It&#39;s never beckoned me to try their ice cream even a smidge because it just looks a bit unprofessional.   Not bad for a late night ice cream run, but I think I prefer Jimbos  
                  Unique flavors that change daily.  $3.50 gets you a generous scoop (a.k.a. a Treat scoop).   My boyfriend and I tried Ube (purple Japanese yam) and Eastside Horchata. The Ube flavor taste was spot-on and the Eastside Horchata was cinnamony goodness.  Can&#39;t wait to come back and see what other flavors they have on display.   Located inside the San Pedro Public Market building.  
                  Pretty tasty flavors.    408: The ice cream itself was pretty mild but nice n creamy and smooth.  The flavors relied heavily on the little bits mixed in which was yum.    Eastside Horchata: This went surprisingly well with the 408 above.  Tasted just like a frozen horchata.  This was my favorite.  I love when an ice cream tastes just like a frozen version of something else.  This is it!  Very very good!  I&#39;ll come back just for this!  Wonder how the horchata is on the westside?  Hmm...  
                  San Pedro Market is very hip and the place to be. Apparently famous Youtubers go here. Treatbot has delicious ice cream and cookies. The horchata ice cream was delicious and not super sweet. Since it was my first time having horchata ice cream, it&#39;s become one of my favorite ice cream flavors overall. It&#39;s a novelty you win&#39;t find in supermarkets. I would take home a year of this stuff if I could. I would come back to try their ice cream sandwiches next time.  
                  Reverting my review back since Treatbot got rid of that stupid ticket system.  Thank you San Pedro for addressing this.  Awesome ice cream, unique flavors.  My only complaint, make the 408 more readily available!!! My friends and I always want this, but it often sells out.  This has got to be my favorite ice cream in the Bay Area, the texture is smooth and creamy, not too firm either, the way ice cream should be.  Even if you take home a pint, it&#39;s still soft right out of the freezer.  I actually haven&#39;t had too many of their flavors, but my favorites are the jackfruit and the 408 (chocolate ice cream with fudge and oreo cookies I believe?).  Anyways be aware that no matter where you find this truck, the flavors change around, but despite this minor inconvenience, their ice cream can&#39;t be beat!  
                  Treatbot is a little food truck inside san pedro square and tastes great (:! It&#39;s a little pricey but if you want a quick bit of ice cream go for it! Their spoons are so fun to use and a bit nostalgic.  
                  Small selection, but they&#39;re gourmet flavors at a reasonable price with a decent amount in each scoop. I&#39;ve been back multiple times, trying the Thai tea flavor, the horchata ice cream with waffle bits, and the lady Godiva flavor, which is cherry flavored with Nutella swirls. Great employees, great concept. I plan to come here whenever I&#39;m at San Pedro square.  
                  Love their horchata ice cream. It&#39;s better to get the ice cream here compared to their trucks because the scoops at this location are actually cold. The food trucks just don&#39;t keep the ice cream cold enough and the ice cream melts super fast. It was nice to actually enjoy a frozen scoop of ice cream to enjoy the flavor of the creamy horchata.  Overall, great ice cream (when it&#39;s cold). I love my ice cream cold, not mushy, and I hate it when my ice cream melts before I can eat it all. I like the 408 as well but I always recommend the horchata. It is on the pricier side but their flavors are worth it.  
                  Double scoop for $5? Hell yeah. The prices here are good, but the flavors are even better.  I&#39;ve consistently been coming here getting the eastside horchata and the 408, which is a caramel ice cream with fudge and oreo cookie pieces. So friggin good. Sometimes I find myself coming to the San Pedro Square Market just to come here.  Anyway, the establishments at the market are now validating parking passes and not some machine. Therefore, it&#39;s up to the worker&#39;s discretion to give you validation. For validation from Treatbot you need to spend over $6... but double scoop is $5.44 w/ tax, weeeeeh. Buy a cookie or something.  
                  AMAZING ICE CREAM!! Would recommend to anyone in the area!!   This little ice cream truck/stand is located in San Pedro&#39;s Square Market in downtown San Jose and you can park across the street for I believe $5, but if you make a purchase of $6 or more at Treatbot you get parking validation. A single scoop is $3.50 and double scoop is $5 if I recall correctly.  Came here with my cousins and a cousin&#39;s friend on a Saturday night after visiting Carmel. We got 2 scoops of the 408 (caramel ice cream, fudge, and oreo cookies), a scoop of Strawberry Fields, and a scoop of the Coffee ice cream.. believe it was Vietnamese coffee flavored. The Strawberry Fields and Coffee scoops tasted like fancy ice cream.. the 408 is unique and a must get when you visit! The consistency and creaminess of the ice cream was unparalleled. Excellent texture, taste, and intense flavors. I&#39;m a fan!   For the amount of ice cream, it does seem a little pricey but what do you expect in the East Bay area..  
                  5/15/15: Decent ice cream, ordinary cookies.  Definitely over hyped.  I would say there&#39;s some of the Diddy Riese syndrome going on, if you&#39;re familiar with the famous ice cream parlor in SoCal--fun ice cream for not too much dough, though in this case not as cheap as Diddy.  Apparently the flavors are hit and miss too...  1. Doublescoop $5...  1a. Ube (ooh-bay) purple yam: I would say this is a milkier, creamier, smoother version of Asian taro ice cream.  I liked it.  I&#39;m not a huge fan of taro ice cream, but I do prefer this flavor to it.  7/10.  2a. Stonefruit Sorbet 21+:  Fail.  Surprised they even put this up.  The 21+ is because it supposedly contains North Coast Gran Cru beer--and though I don&#39;t taste the beer, I think this ultimately made the sorbet suck.  I tried making a few grand marnier ice creams before and when I try to put in too much alcohol the ice cream turned out less creamy and smooth, and just didn&#39;t have an appetizing texture.  That&#39;s what this one is like--chunky, icy, and just not good.  You get some peach, citrus, and... rind.  Yeah, no good.  3/10.  2. Cookies (Chocolate Chip) $1.25:  Got 2 cookies for the price.  The cookies are very ordinary.  Maybe even slightly stale.  Absolutely nothing special about these cookies.  5/10.  So, really, one failed flavor.  Worse-than-costco cookies.  Like Diddy, the ultra-high rating of 4.5 is probably just for the fun, and not much else.  Well, Diddy&#39;s cookies are better too.  3/5.  #icecream #sorbet  
                  Treatbot, the perfect ice cream truck that is located INSIDE of a building???   After following Google maps, I finally located Treatbot! I was one of the rookies who kept looking up and down the street for an ice cream truck, but couldn&#39;t find it. After reading the address for the last time, I figured it had to be inside of the building I kept circling.  Anyway...  I&#39;ve been to Treatbot a couple times, and I&#39;ve had &#34;Milk and Cookies&#34; ice cream, and &#34;408&#34; ice cream in a cup. &#34;408&#34; is my favorite thus far, as it has a unique taste that I haven&#39;t had before, while &#34;Milk and Cookies&#34; is basically cookies and cream, which you can find anywhere.  Due to Treatbot being located inside of San Pedro Square Market, you get a great view of other eateries that are reasonably priced.  
                  Oh, yes, TREATBOT, you&#39;re SOOOOOO good. You make me happy, even though you make me fat. I love you, I want you, I think about you all of the time.  I like your 408, your horchata, the cookie monster, the german chocolate cake, ump.  it&#39;s all so very nice. Call me.  
                  Short and simple: 1) Service is always awesome and quick! 2) 408 and Irish Dream are an excellent combination 3) Treatbot offers that small amount of sweetness that you want after a delicious meal.   If you are in San Pedro Market, you must get ice cream here!  
                  Every time I order ice cream here, they have never disappointed me one bit. They have a great selection of ice cream and during the Superbowl 50 celebration, I was privileged to have tried their Thai ice cream on a cone. Normally, I would do it with the cookies, but that night I decide to go the ol&#39; fashion way and just have a scoop in a cone! And boy was it delicious! The owners are Filipinos I think, so they have a karaoke challenge they have setup that night; if you sing and get a 95 score, then your ice cream is free. I didn&#39;t want to bankrupt them hehe, not because I can sing, but I have the same Magic Sing karaoke that they have haha (every Pinoy knows what I am referring to)!  
                  Came here after a yelp elite event and thought the ice cream was just ok.  Cute concept with the make shift ice cream truck.  Would i come back? Sure, ice cream is ice cream.  What i had...  408 (vanilla, carmel, fudge): (3/5)  Milk chocolate (4/5)  Overall too creamy for me.  
                  The dairy free ones always surprise me, I love the strawberry basil and the rose ones! It&#39;s a go-to place whenever I&#39;m in San Pedro.  
                  This place is yummy! And it&#39;s in the perfect location, with a decent price, courteous service, and the flavors are unique.  My favorite flavors are the horchata, honey lavender, and thai tea. A far cry from the quintessential strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla, but it works and it&#39;s perfect!  The cones are ok, I go with the sugar cone. It&#39;d be nice if they offered a waffle cone... *hint hint*  
                  Love the 408! Reference picture! It was my first time here and I was originally looking for a malt at this place but it&#39;s only ice cream! The 408 exceeded my expectations and made me forget about my malt. Portion looked small but was definitely the right size! A perfect way to end a meal with a dessert like the 408!  
                  The 408, Horchata, and Ube makes me want to come here because I&#39;m a foodie The flavors are great, and the price is not bad Think this place is here to stay, it&#39;s not a trendy fad The ambiance is legit, cool and hip people here They be consuming large amounts of food, ice cream and beer  Really liked this spot.  The ice cream is tasty and I really liked the ube.  The waffle cone is &#34;good&#34;, and the ice cream solid, but in terms of the 3-star review, if it only tasted a bit better, a little more &#34;awesome&#34; for the price, then I&#39;d give it more stars.  The 408, though good, tasted like any kind of ice cream you&#39;d get elsewhere, sort of like a mocha almond fudge.  Though again, the ube was good, but not good enough to push it to the 4th star.  
                  This place has delicious ice cream and it&#39;s relatively cheap too. I had the Horchata snickerdoodle ice cream sandwich / double scoop of sriracha chocolate caramel and it came out to about $7-8 total for huge servings that I wasn&#39;t able to finish. The horchata snickerdoodle ice cream sandwich was a gem but definitely a little too sweet so I couldn&#39;t eat the entire thing without suffering from a diabetic attack. I&#39;ll be back to try the ube the next time I&#39;m in San Jose.  Parking is a pain and it&#39;s in this shady food plaza smack dab in Downtown SJ.  
                  Although, I&#39;m lactose.  I still wanted to try this place out. I never been to this part of San Pedro Square.  So  after I went to a yelp elite event, I decided to check the place out with a few people from the elite event.  I tried the Eastside Horchata single scoop.  It was pretty tasty.   I would come back, or tell other people about this place. Decent pricing for a single scoop.  
                  Once I saw the mouthwatering Thai Tea, Horchata, &amp; Lavender Ice Cream photos on Yelp, I immediately &#34;Bookmarked&#34; and knew I just had to try this place out. My BF took me here for my BDAY weekend even though he wanted boba (thanks babe!), and I&#39;m so glad that he did because the ice cream was so creamy and just full of deliciousness!   I decided to try the Graham Cracker+Cream &amp; Pumpkin Spice Ice Cream (2 huge, generous scoops for $5). It was totally worth the long walk from the parking garage! Prior to coming here, I didn&#39;t know that their flavors vary daily so I was kinda disappointed they didn&#39;t have the flavors I was looking forward to trying in the first place. My BF wanted to try the Coconut ice cream but the employee kindly told us that it was too frozen and would&#39;ve taken longer to thaw. At least she tried to scoop it to begin with, and was being honest.  They also serve their ice creams in waffle cones or cookies (3 diff. types of cookies: Snickerdoodle, Choc. chip, forgot the 3rd one). I tried my BF&#39;s &#34;408&#34; ice cream sandwich and it wasn&#39;t bad, but the cookie wasn&#39;t as soft &amp; chewy as expected. Maybe it would&#39;ve tasted better with a different cookie?   My only recommendation is that they post on social media what their flavors of the day are. Other than that, I would definitely come back and try other flavors here!  
                  One of my most favorite ice cream places in SJ. Note that they are not your typical Baskin Robbins or Cold Stone with 20 flavors to choose from. Treatbot serves probably like 8-10 flavors that CONSTANTLY change so if you like a flavor, it ain&#39;t gonna stay there forever.   I love the uniqueness in their flavors. My favorites are the Honey Lavender, Rosie&#39;s Dates, Horchata, and Thai Tea. Their scoops are pretty generous for $3.50.   Be aware they have the $100 &#34;make it rain&#34; order. So if you&#39;re lucky, someone ahead of you may have paid it forward and your ice cream will be free! It never happened to me, but Im always hoping lol.  
                  The Eastside Horchata tastes exactly like what horchata would be as an ice cream. It&#39;s also very soft and silky looking. The texture reminds me of the nitrogen ice cream. The mango is good but the horchata steals the show.  The vanilla is always my go-to when I can&#39;t decide on anything else. It&#39;s rich and creamy.   It&#39;s $5 for two scoops. It&#39;s about average pricing for ice cream but you&#39;ll have trouble finishing it anyway. The scoops are generous and are gorgeous.  
                  The Eastside Horchata and Mexican Chocolate were super good. Definitely consider this premium ice cream. I also love the aesthetic of the truck itself. This is something I want in a dessert experience! Being inside the San Pedro Square Market is a huge plus, reminds me of open air markets like in LA and Seattle, only much less crowded and way more clean. Service was fast, nothing outstanding, but that&#39;s okay with me.  
                  Wholly gee whiz Batman! This place has good ice cream!   Never tired the ice cream here until yesterday and I feel like I find my long lost brother separated at birth! It&#39;s an awesome discovery and quality of the ice cream must be that they keep the cows in the back and have them working 24/7. They probably also feed them beer like those Kobe cows in Japan!   Either way, the ice cream here is amazing. You will not be disappointed!  
                  Located in a pretty neat warehouse-like location, Treatbot serves some of the best ice cream I have had.  My friend and I tried:  *Eastside Horchata: My favorite! Similar to the drink, this flavor has a light hint of cinnamon to it but not overwhelming. I highly recommend this for first-timers.  *408: Pretty good, on the sweeter side for me. It was a caramel based ice cream with Oreo bits in them. A close second favorite!  *Bananutella: I&#39;m not really a fan of bananas, so I&#39;m a bit biased towards not recommending this. I could barely taste the Nutella flavor, as the banana base was very overpowering.  Parking is all street with credit card/coin meters. You can also download the Luxe app and use the code JULIA6 for $20 credit towards valet parking.  
                  SO DELICIOUS!!! We had two scoops of ice cream, ube and thai tea, for $5. One scoop is $3 if I remember correctly. The ube was thick and creamy with little grainy bits of ube. A lot of places have thai tea ice cream that taste more like vanilla and weak in tea flavor, but the one here had a strong taste of thai tea. My bf and I couldn&#39;t decide which one we liked more.  We also sampled horchata and some other fruit sherbet flavor (puckerberry I think). Horchata flavor was perfect with the light texture of cinnamon specks. The tart one was good too, especially if you&#39;re a big fan of tart and fruity flavors.   Will be back to try their other flavors like Mexican chocolate and coconut!  
                  This place is a super treat, especially on a hot day. I came in on a Saturday afternoon and immediately my eyes went to ice cream.   You can opt to try samples but I already knew which flavors caught my eye. The 408 (caramel with fudge and Oreos) and the Mint Condition (mint and Oreos). 2 scoops for $5. I got the scoops in a little container and the portions were generous.   Located in the 2nd building of the Public Market towards the back corner. Excellent place for ice cream!  
                  Ice cream? Yes please. All the scoops.   Always seem to end up here when I&#39;m inside SPSM. Ice cream is a me magnet, basically. I&#39;ve had a bunch of their flavors, and they&#39;re all good, but my top two are Horchata &amp; Thai Tea.   Plus they do karaoke. And that&#39;s always pure entertainment.  
                  Note that I just came back from the land of Gelato--Italy not long ago! The weather in bay area has been scorching enough that I was craving for ice cream.  I had honey lavender and mint chocolate, both are delicious! I love how it changes flavors daily, but I encourage people asking for a tasting if they are feeling unsure. I love both my flavor, and I regret that I didn&#39;t see they make waffle cones on site until later!!!!   Will definitely back for the waffle cones!  
                  Yelp removed my original review because the  &#34;support team has determined that it falls outside their Content Guidelines ( yelp.com/guidelines ) because it lacks a firsthand customer experience.&#34;  So I had to rewrite it while keeping in mind their Content Guidelines:  I love the 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408! 408!  
                  Treatbot looks like a immobile food truck, which adds to its appeal of somewhere trendy to get your ice cream. Unfortunately, it&#39;s not my favorite place for ice cream :-(. I got the 408 and though it was a delicious sugar heaven for my taste buds, I couldn&#39;t finish it as it was too sweet! I felt like I would get diabetes afterwards. So sadly, Treatbot isn&#39;t for me :(  
                  Solid selection of ice creams with a fairly &#39;homemade&#39; vibe. A handful of the flavored are very meh but the standard chocolate and mint chip are A-OK in my book. Definitely easy to grab a scoop while you&#39;re hanging at San Pedro Square.  
                  (: Boba-Foodaholic Says :)  My order: 2 Scoops (408 + Milk&amp;Cookies)   So I was craving for an ice cream at 9:30PM and I found this place that was open till 10PM and that their ice cream were made freshly the day they sell. So why not try out this :) So we went there around 9:40PM which they weren&#39;t close nor preparing to close. I was expecting a lot of favor due to a lot pictures that were posted on yelp. I know that I was gonna get the 408 flavors because everyone said that you should get it and the most popular flavor.   I wasn&#39;t sure about the second flavor because I was expecting more flavors like the yelp pictures. But I went there too late at night, which there weren&#39;t that much flavors left over. When I went there, the only ones were:  * 408 (Carmel ice cream with fudge &amp; Oreos) * Eastside Horchata * Milk and Cookies - Old School Vanilla - Chocolate Salted Caramel  * Mexi Mocha (Mocha ice cream with ability chips)  - Eggnog - Peppermint Bark - Banana Coconut Sorbet   The best thing about here was THE SERVICE!!!!!!!!!  He told me that I can try the flavors if I am not sure which flavor to get, since it was my first time. So I tried out 4 flavors and decided to get 408 and Milk &amp; Cookies. Whenever I got Baskin Robins or Cold Stones, they always show that nasty faces when I ask them if I can try 2 or more flavors. However, this guy never showed me that face but asked simple question, &#34;How about this flavor?&#34;   Their ice cream is the best as well. I never tasted that kind of CHEWY and TASTY ice cream in my life. It was like a gelato in Italy that I tried and also it tasted so FRESH which makes me to come everyday here. But I couldn&#39;t ask this question to him, but why do they do their ice cream in the tray and not in the cup? I wanted to get a pint size with different flavors but it says only one flavor, which was not happy but I will definitely come back!!!  
                  Horchata horchata!!!! It&#39;s a must. If you haven&#39;t tried it you better or else you&#39;re just missing out. And 408?!?! My favorite when I&#39;m feeling chocolate.  
                  Ube Ice Cream!    The texture of their ice cream is nice and fluffy.  You might as well get two scoops because it&#39;s not that much of a price difference.  This location is a great place to grab some dessert after some dinner and/or beer around the area...or before if that&#39;s your thing.  
                  Treatbot Factory was a little disappointing for me, given the high reviews on Yelp. I had been hopeful for a five-star experience, but mine was an average one.   The available flavors did not sound too awesome, mainly because I was in the mood for something fruity tasting after being out in the sun and heat and there were not too many fruity flavors to try: one was strawberry basil, the other was mangolada, and another was orange made with beer (I believe). I sampled all three, but the only passable one seemed to be the mangolada.   Although I don&#39;t mind paying higher costs for delicious things, I was too underwhelmed to justify the $3 scoop.   If I ever go back here, I&#39;ll consult Yelp and order a more popular flavor. But in the meantime, I&#39;m not in any rush to return.  
                  Ummmm okay. Treatbot has to be by far one of the best ice cream places I have ever tried. Like I can&#39;t even. It&#39;s 7:50 AM and it&#39;s been two days since I had my double scoop of the 408 and horchata and I&#39;m still thinking about it!   The consistency of the ice cream is perfection. The flavors are all there. The horchata is packed with cinnamon and the Oreo crumbles along with the caramel flavor in the 408 just works. Treatbot has become a staple when I&#39;m craving ice cream. The flavors served do change, but the Horchata and 408 are always on the menu. Praise the ice cream gods!   For serious, I don&#39;t come to San Pedro Market to drink, I come there for Treatbot ice cream.  
                  The mocha ice cream is super chocolatey! I tried the pandan macapuno ice cream as well &amp; it tasted like the dried coconut strips (that come in pink, green and white) that come in Vietnamese new year (tet) gift boxes. It had chunks of dried coconut &amp; tasted great. However, the pandan ice cream @ Van&#39;s Bakery on Tully is hands down the best pandan ice cream I&#39;ve ever had. I love the visual concept of this ice cream spot. Treatbot is an ice cream truck that stationed inside San Pedro Square. The flavor options include lots of Filipino flavors like ube. I recall that Treatbot was a karaoke ice cream truck but this indoors location doesn&#39;t have karaoke (as I can see). Treatbot also caters so you could have Treatbot @ your wedding!!!! (or birthday party). I like how they have a San Jose inspired flavor called the 408 (caramel, oreo, fudge). It&#39;d probably be more appropriate if the 408 was a Mexican hot chocolate flavor mixed with pandan.  
                  Unique seasonal flavors.  Great consistency and texture.  None of that new age hippie healthy ice cream.  This is straight creamy and very old fashioned.  
                  Karaoke ice cream truck in San Pedro Square = GENIUS!   Love the creaminess of the ice cream and the originality of flavors. My fav, the Eastside Horchata has just the right amount of cinnamon to make it flavorful and makes you wanting more.  I had to stop myself from getting another scoop! I have yet to try the cookies or the cones, but I&#39;ll definitely be back for it...  Oh, and my son wanted one of the really cool Treatbot t-shirts being sold for $5 but they were out of his size. Hoping they&#39;ll have a medium next time we&#39;re there!  
                  This place isn&#39;t bad!  Came here recently and tried the 408 w/ Snickerdoodle. I forget what is included in the 408, but I really liked it. It wasn&#39;t too overpowered w/ chocolate and it definitely tasted pretty good stuffed between the Snickerdoodle cookies.  My gf&#39;s Graham Cracker and Pumpkin Spice ice cream both tasted pretty good and definitely tasted better than the ice cream you would get served at the standard commercialized chains.  Service was friendly and efficient.   Prices weren&#39;t too bad.  Only downsides were the flavor selection on our visit. They ran out of the Eastside Horchata, and they didn&#39;t have the coconut ice cream ready as well, since it wasn&#39;t soft yet to serve. Basically only like 5-6 flavors actually available to serve at the time.  
                  I love my ice cream! There&#39;s so many unique and exotic flavors at this place and that&#39;s what keeps me coming back. Of course they have the typical vanilla, chocolate, milk and cookies (cookies n cream basiaclly), mint and chocolate, etc. But some flavors I&#39;ve seen were horchata, avocado, taro, thai tea, honey lavender, strawberry basil, mango, and some other special creations such as 408! There&#39;s a girl scout thin mint flavor one too.  The ones I&#39;ve actually tried: - Horchata - Could use a little more cinnamon, too milky IMO - Dark Chocolate - Delish! Perfect for any chocolate lover - Strawberry Basil Sorbet - My favorite so far! Strawberry flavor was not artificial and perfectly sweet, and the basil in it gave it even more flavor. It was like a strawberry mojito/daquiri! - Milk and Cookies - Could use more cookies! Very rich and creamy on the milk side.  $1 Scoops on Thursdays if you Karaoke! They give pretty decent scoops too, $1 would be a steal for this quality ice cream.  
                  Ice cream soo creamy and tasty :) very unique flavors! I got the Eastside Horchata and fell in love with the consistency of the ice cream and the delicious flavor that had the perfect amount of cinnamon to really remind you of a legit horchata.  I would stick to just ordering scoops of ice cream instead of the cookie ice cream sandwiches. It&#39;s definitely better than your typical Dryer&#39;s ice cream so it&#39;s worth it to splurge a little on this delicious sweet treat. And it&#39;s actually super affordable compared to other specialty ice cream places... at least compared to the ones I go to in the OC.  
                  It&#39;s an ice cream truck inside of San Pedro Market. In my opinion a little over priced. Five dollars for two scoops that looked similar to kiddie scoops, but you be the judge I will post a picture. Service was super fast for a Saturday. There was already a line when we arrived but he moved the line quickly. The guy was very polite that&#39;s always a plus with me . As far as ice cream goes I absolutely loved the Eastside horchata it was pretty delicious. The 408 was good but I expected it to be better from the reviews. Overall dessert was good but I guess that I was expecting more because of the over hyped reviews. Not sure if I would return because I can get more for my buck elsewhere.  
                  First time here and I am absolutely hooked! If I lived in San Jose, I would come all the time. Doublescoop for $5?! Yes, please!  This is a small truck located inside San Pedro Square. They have a screen displaying their flavors and allow you to sample as many as you would like. It was hard to pick, but we finally chose the horchata and Thai tea flavors. Both were rich in flavor, but weren&#39;t too sweet so we were able to finish the entire doublescoop without feeling sick. I love their creative flavors. I hope they decide to branch out and keep their quality high!  
                  The quick review:  5 Stars for Ice Cream goodness 1 Star for not stocking enough cones and cookies.  2 Stars for price and value. Scoops are relatively small. $5 for two scoops.   Averages out to 2.5 stars, but I&#39;ll give them the extra .5. I came here hoping for an ice cream sandwich, but after a 20 minute drive, I wasn&#39;t going to leave empty handed. I got the doublescoop, Horchata and Macapuno.   Better go to Costco and buy more cones and cookies!  
                  OMFG, a whole load of awesomeness in my mouth!!!   My boyfriend and I found this place inside the market, and thought we should try it out, and we got the ice cream cookie. This place beats all the other ice cream cookies that I&#39;ve ever tried. Especially Cream, I think cream&#39;s ice cream is much harder to eat and their cookies are not soft. Although this place only have two types of cookies to choose from, they&#39;re both really good. You only have the option of chocolate chips or snicker-doodles. They had a variety of ice cream that you can choose from, I heard they change their ice cream often so they may not have the same flavors but their all tasty. I got the snicker doodles with the milk and cookie ice cream. The snicker doodles were super soft, when I bit into it with the ice cream... everything just melted in my mouth, it was delicious. The whole thing only cost $5. If you don&#39;t want the cookie and just want a scoop of ice cream it was only $3.25. But it was totally worth it.  I would definitely come back here to try their other flavors. The milk and cookie ice cream was really good, it had other cookie flavors/crumbs incorporated into the ice cream. Must try this place out! Would not be disappointed.  
                  the perfect spot to accommodate drunk times. came here on a Friday night and the bars were crazy crowded but surprisingly there wasn&#39;t much line. Got the 408 flavor and the milk and cookies! Perfect spot to hit the block. Definitely will come back after San Pedro festivities!  
                  Unimpressed. I had the 408. The texture was spot on...creamy and smooth, but the flavor just didn&#39;t do it for me. The 408 Carmel comes with fudge and Oreo cookie bits so I expected rich flavor, but it just tasted bland. I&#39;ve had better ice cream from the grocery store.   I will probably give Treatbot one more try and see if I like any of the other flavors. But for now, I will remain unimpressed.  
                  I was disappointed that they didn&#39;t have the 408 flavor when I went, BUT what I did get was super yummy anyway. I got the cherry oatmeal ice cream and it was SO GOOD! The snickerdoodle cookies are awesome, too!  Cute storefront... looks like a food truck but it&#39;s inside and not mobile. They have a big container of water that you can help yourself to also... always a plus.  I would definitely come back to try other flavors when I&#39;m in the area and it&#39;s dessert time!  
                  Treatbot is a trendy, local San Jose ice cream store with a physical location inside San Pedro Square and a mobile truck that roams the customary places (including Moveable Feast!)  The local 408 flavor is prominent in the flavors and names of the flavors. Favorites here include the Eastside Horchata and Thai Tea. Their menu does rotate, though!   Quite fairly priced for the amount they give you. The ice cream is rich, creamy, and slow-to-melt. A+  
                  Dear Treatbot, I had a wonderful time with you last Friday. I can&#39;t stop thinking about you. When can I see you again? I wish you were closer to me so I can have you all the time!  Head over heels, Earlene  Jokes and creepiness aside, this little indoor ice cream truck is decadent and delicious!! The Coconut Joy was amazing.  
                  Why is there a truck parked in the middle of a market? IT&#39;S TREATBOT! Huzzah!  Thankful to have a delightful ice cream truck inside a food wonderland. It&#39;s always nice to walk around downtown SJ and top the night off with ice cream! The flavors here are always so much fun, and regardless of all the different creamy concoctions I&#39;ve tried here, I have yet to be disappointed! So woohoo! Prices are average! Service is friendly! Portions match the prices! What more can I say?! I&#39;m glad this truck is in SJ!!!  Honey lavender is so bomb yo. If it&#39;s in stock at the time! So nice and silky. Ermergerd.  
                  I&#39;ve been a Treatbot fan for a while since they debuted long ago when their first truck was parked in tandem with the MoGo truck in Milpitas and San Jose.  Since it&#39;s been a few years since their first scoop, I&#39;m glad to see that they have a location in the bustling San Pedro Square complex.  The last time I came here, I stopped by in here to chill and relax while the post Sharks game traffic was clearing out.  I had their seasonal pumpkin flavor since I&#39;m a huge fan of pumpkin anything.  The single scoop is pretty large so they definitely do not hold back on the size.  I am curious to see who will sing a song for one dollar scoops but since when does anyone need any incentive to karaoke? Sure someone post your video online and ridicule you publicly but hey, own your voice and style as many fashion designers like to say.  Definitely will be back here again as I am going to be at more Sharks games later this season!  
                  There ice cream is pretty good!   I finally was able to try it and it was delicious. The parking may be hard on the streets but it is okay. There are a lot of people usually when there are sports playing but its a good spot to get ice cream and dinner around the food court.  
                  A bit pricey but definitely worth trying because they specialize in having unique ice cream flavors.  I got a scoop of Thai tea with a snicker doodle cookie. I really enjoyed the ice cream. Tasted just like Thai tea. Every bite was delicious! The cookie, on the other hand, was hard :( Spare your $1. I also tried my friend&#39;s Vietnamese coffee ice cream and I liked it a lot!  I probably wouldn&#39;t come back since there&#39;s so many other places to try but I definitely  don&#39;t regret trying this place either.  
                  A food truck located inside San Pedro Sq - cool. Stopped here for a sweet treat. On a Saturday afternoon, it looked like everyone else had the same idea because there was a sizeable line. One of the first things I noticed is the &#34;make it rain&#34; option where you can drop a hundred bucks and pay for $100 of ice cream for everyone behind you. It&#39;s such a cool karma thing to do. I would think you could put down any amount (like $20) and make it sprinkle at least for the immediate group behind you. Anyways I split a double scoop ($5) of the 408 and the strawberry fields flavors with a friend. They serve it in a kinda flimsy paper container (similar to what you can put fries in) so better eat your ice cream quickly not to soak through the paper. The 408 is vanilla ice cream with oreo and caramel. So good. And I&#39;m a huge strawberry fan so I like the strawberry fields. I also taste tested the basalmic strawberry and it was great too. Tried my other friend&#39;s Thai tea and horchata. These were fantastic also. Like the cool, different flavors.  
                  Treatbot is located inside the San Pedro Square Market, a well-decorated warehouse filled with many different smaller eateries.   The entire store is a food truck parked inside the building, with a flat screen TV on the outside,  making it easy for customers to see the prices.  My friend and I ordered a double scoop for $5. We got Mint Condition and Honey Lavender. Upon the first bite, I was surprised at the light, yet creamy texture of the ice cream. The Mint Condition is reminiscent of Thin Mints, while the honey in the Honey Lavender stands out without overpowering the flavor. All of the ice cream is made in-house. However, I was a bit disappointed that the cones were sold out, but it was toward the end of the night when I came in.   Parking for the San Pedro Square Market is in a parking center across the street, but there is a parking validation machine right in front of the Treatbot truck that makes it convenient to validate.  
                  I like that whenever we dine at San Pedro Square Market we can always count on Treatbot sitting there with no long line, ready for us to order ice cream for dessert.  I really like their Horchata and Ube flavor. And I totally appreciate that they do ice cream sandwiches here too and for a decent price (comparable to CREAM).  One reason why I&#39;m not giving them 5 stars? The consistency of the ice cream isn&#39;t too awesome for me. It&#39;s still kinda icy and it melt wayyy too fast.  But still, a great place to grab a quick scoop or two of a funky flavor of ice cream.  
                  Intense in flavor without being overtly sweet Smooth, creamy texture  Good variety to satisfy anyone&#39;s sweet tooth  Like the whimsical novel theme of their establishment   Overall Thoughts  Will be back to sample more flavors!  
                  The 408 flavor lives up to the hype:  yelp.com/biz_photos/trea…  Very addictive.  Caramel ice cream with fudge chunks and oreos.  The waffle cone is OK, nothing special.  
                  Woohoo! No more chasing the Treatbot truck around anymore, as it lays comfortably stationary in the San Pedro Market.  After a brief tasting at SP2 in the area, my friends and I were awkwardly drawn to a poor- maybe drunk rendition of &#34;Baby Got Back&#34; at Treatbot&#39;s Karaoke station.  I ordered a single scoop of Eastside Horchata, which is a flavor I don&#39;t think you can get anywhere else. The texture is perfect, rich, creamy but not cloying on the tongue. Nice amount of sweetness and spice, literally Horchata redone in a frozen state, all you&#39;re missing is the straw!  Price is a bit steep, if you&#39;re used to buying Dreyers at your grocery store or if you&#39;re not a regular at most chain ice cream shops, but $4 for a delectably delicious scoop of ice cream here is well worth it. Yum!  Only strange thing is they scoop your ice cream in a small paper tray .. bring back the cups made of corn! /hippierantover  
                  Treatbot provides the perfect dessert after a delicious lunch at the San Pedro Market.  I was lucky to sample the 408 which was absolutely delicious, but I decided to get the Milk and Cookies which was very very good.  I think it is a wonderful thing to have the $100 Make it Rain on the menu.  My trip to Treatbot was blessed by the $100 Make it Rain, so of course free ice cream is always the best ice cream!  Nonetheless, it is very inspiring and I hope to pay it forward somehow in the future  : )  
                  What a cute idea - roll a food truck in as your storefront!  We treated our kids to ice cream here.  I forgot the names they gave to the flavors, but my son and niece loved their chocolate ice cream with chocolate chips, and my nephew loved the version of cookies and cream.  The waffle cone was very thin and light, and I really liked it.  If we visit this marketplace again, I&#39;ll end my meal with a treat from Treatbot again.  
                  Lisa at Treat Bot made my gluten and dairy free wedding cake, and, OMG, it was awesome! Not only was it gorgeous, but it tasted amazing. Cristine coordinated the details and Lisa delivered and assembled the three tier cake on time at my wedding venue. Thank you, thank you, thank you! I highly recommend working with these ladies for catering of any party!  
                  The good news: Its super yummy. Seriously! Lovely flavor and texture for both the 408 and the macapuno were so delicious. The texture is so nicely creamy and dense that its almost like a frozen custard, which I really like for its luxurious texture. Although the 408 is the most popular favorite, I ordered the macaroon just to see if they took equal care on making lesser known flavors and was so pleasantly surprised because this is the best macapuno I have ever tasted. Its delicate flavors were clearly present and the tiny chunks of young coconut gave it a lively texture contrast against the ice cream itself.  The bad news: The wooden spoon!!! I don&#39;t believe that they serve a premium product at a premium price with a rough wooden spoon to eat it. This is just not right. My Tongue nearly shriveled when it came i contact with the rough, dry texture of the flat wooden spoon. This i step kind of spoon that they used to give us when w were kids so they could be destroyed and thrown away. With a premium product. For this product I would use the new biodegradable spoons that are as smooth as plastic but are nice to the environment.  The service was except, with prompt, quick friendly attention. I asked several questions, all of when were answered promptly and satisfactorily.  Change the spoon and this could be my new favorite ice cream treat.  
                  Love the 408!!!!!! Highly recommend everyone to try this flavor!   A bit pricey for ice cream, but when you can indulge and spend money, I say spend it on ice cream! Pretty cool how the truck is inside San Pedro Square. It is a more lively atmosphere compared to what it used to be.  
                  I was so happy to hear that they established a stationary location for treatbot. Even though I love chasing the food truck around town just to get my ice cream fix, I am glad that now I can grab some delicious bites at San Pedro Market and then get some awesome ice cream too.  My favorite flavor is the horchata, but on this occasion I got the 408 which has caramel, fudge and Oreo cookies. I think I might have a new favorite. I liked that every bite was a little different, maybe one part had extra caramel or Oreo cookie. I can&#39;t wait to get another scoop.  This would have gotten a perfect 5 star experience if they didn&#39;t run out of everything that day. i usually get an ice cream sandwich or a waffle cone, but they were sadly out of both. I will definitely be back to get my Treatbot fix, especially on Thursday night when they have their karaoke night.  
                  Best ice cream in town. Eastside Horchata is my favorite but have yet to find one I don&#39;t like. Lines usually long, but it&#39;s worth the wait. The customer service is always great. I try not to eat too much ice cream, but if I&#39;m going to splurge, I&#39;m coming here.  
                  Did not know this place even existed until I was strolling around looking for some type of dessert to satisfied my sweet tooth. Found this at the corner of the San Pedro Square and instantly wanted their ice cream on the spot.   I got Banananutella and Ube on an almond cone. It was incredibly scrumptious! Can&#39;t wait to come back and try their other unique flavors of ice cream.   Funny how about two weeks later at my friends birthday party, I met the owner who own this place. I remembered raving about how much I loved their Banananutella ice cream. Small world and I&#39;m glad I met the owner. Nice and friendly people. Definitely recommend this place to my friends.  
                  $1 scoops with each sung song on Karaoke Thursdays! I like that this place is in the San Pedro Market area. It&#39;s a cute little truck. I got a scoop of Milk and Cookies. I liked it. Not too sweet and the right amount of rich. My friend got the horchata flavor. It was a little on the sweet side, and I wish there was more cinnamon in it, but it was enjoyable still!  Definitely coming back to try the other flavors. :)  
                  Friendly service, a scoop of ice cream is $3.75 and it&#39;s all very fresh. Smashed between cookies ($5) it&#39;s even better!  Had the orange sorbet last time and it was refreshing.  
                  A couple of interesting flavors and they let you try as much as you want! A good selection for combos with waffle cones, cookies, etc. Great dessert after eating at the market. Super cute looking food truck with plenty of places to sit.  
                  Most ice cream places usually taste the same to me.  But I&#39;m so glad my girls and I decided to get some ice cream in the San Pedro Square market after eating dinner down the street.  Enter: Treatbot Ice Cream truck, which is permanently stationed inside San Pedro Square Market.  Remember that big empty space behind the railings at Blush when it first opened? Yeah, there&#39;s actual restaurants and dining tables in there now.   I ordered the 408 which is caramel ice cream mixed with fudge and oreo cookie.  Super delicious because it wasn&#39;t too sweet and and not too exotically flavored either (vs. honey lavender which I heard is like eating potpourri).  You also have the option to make an ice cream sandwich with two cookies, or just buy a cookie on the side.  And if you&#39;re ever feeling generous you can order the &#34;Make it Rain&#34; by buying $100 worth of ice cream to the next X amount of customers until $100 worth of ice cream is provided.  
                  So delicious! I love the 408 and the East side Horchata! I love that you can customize it with different types of cones or cookies. Can&#39;t wait to try out the avocado ice cream... But everyone I&#39;ve gone, they didn&#39;t have it. Staff are very friendly and they are so nice to let you sample.  
                  Loved it! Tried the honey lavender great consistency and super creamy just like how an ice cream should be!! It was a party in my tummy! The vanilla waffle cone is worth the extra $1.00. It&#39;s a bit thinner than a normal waffle cone but the subtle vanilla flavor added a great taste.  
                  I have always loved the Treatbot karaoke ice cream truck and having a permanent location inside San Pedro Square Market makes it much easier to get my lovely treats. Some of my favorite ice cream flavors include the black marble raspberry which is creamy, tart, sweet and goes very well with their waffle cones. I also love the 408, young coconut and any of the daily sorbets. Every now and then, they would have pandan waffle bowls which go great with the tropical flavors. If you&#39;re not sure what flavor you&#39;ll enjoy, you can sample any of the flavors before you make your decision. But what I really love the most when they have it, is the treatpopsicles, especially the strawberry kiwi popsicle!  When, and I mean, when, they make their own popsicles, it is amazing. Every now and then, you&#39;ll find Mexican paletas and it doesn&#39;t feel the same. However, when they offer the strawberry kiwi popsicle, I go crazy! There are chunks of strawberry and a huge slice of kiwi inside the popsicle. Get it when you see it and you will thank me! My other to go popsicle is the watermelon. Service is great and I love how I can always end my meals at San Pedro Square Market with a scoop or a stick of ice cream from Treatbot!  
                  Treatbot is by far one of the best ice cream  I have tried in San Jose. My boyfriend and I always treat ourselves to this after dining out at San Pedro. All of their ice creams are flavorful, rich and creamy. My favorite out of all is the 408 flavor which has caramel and chunks of Oreo cookies. I need to have this before the summer ends!  
                  OMG I love Treatbot!   On my journey to find the best creamery in the area, I have tried many ice cream shops in the South Bay but mostly left disappointed. However, I had the chance to try Treatbot at the Movable Feast in Blossom Hill and I loved it!   I tried the 408 and ET. Both were really tasty and the the consistency of the ice cream is perfect. I am not ashamed to admit that I went the next day to San Pedro because I wanted to try another flavor. This time I got the lavender honey and the eastside horchata. Both were unique and also really yummy. For a first timer, I recommend the 408, it really is one of their best flavors.   They have fun flavors, friendly staff and really great ice cream! I hope to try a cookie sandwich next time.  
                  Just came here last Saturday, and tried 4 flavors (Horchata, Rose, Honey Lavender, and Strawberry Basil) before ordering Rose + Horchata in a waffle cone.  My God, the Rose just blew me away -- the perfect levels of Rose, sweetness, creaminess, and iciness.  Definitely try it if it&#39;s offered when you&#39;re here!  The Horchata was good but paled for me in comparison.  The waffle cone was tasty but rather delicate -- it may be worth asking for a cup, since mine started falling apart in about 30 seconds.  Next time, I&#39;m going to go for a pint of the Rose!  
                  I love me some ice cream! I&#39;m so happy that they have a permanent location because in all honesty, I don&#39;t have time to stalk them when I want my fix. Whenever I decide to have lunch or dinner at San Pedro Market, I come here for my dessert round.   I love their creative homemade ice cream flavors. I&#39;m not your average vanilla or chocolate ice cream girl. I&#39;m in it for all the &#34;exotic&#34; crazy flavors I haven&#39;t tried or heard of before. I loved their graham cracker &amp; milk, avocado, and red bean flavors. On the other hand, I didn&#39;t like the east side horchata and I&#39;m a sucker for horchata. It left a weird itch in the back of my throat and it was too sweet for me.   Definitely will come back and try more since they always rotate their flavors ;)  
                  Three numbers: 408. Crushed oreo bits are twirled and spun by silky threads of caramel swirling around the deliciously rich and decadent vanilla-caramel ice cream.  Every time we come to San Pedro Square Market, we pick up a pint of 408.   Whenever a pint of 408 finds its way to our freezer, it&#39;s finished within the week.   Any time our freezer is depleted of its vital 408 supply, we go back to SPSM to restore our freezer&#39;s health from 0/408 back to 408/408.  It&#39;s that good!  
                  DAT HORCHATA ICE CREAM DOE *in love*   Can I get a yumm-freakin-myyyy!!? My friend and I were surfing the place after grabbing a couple of drinks and looking for that last sweet dish to complete our food adventures. We decided on Treatbot because it was a hot day, and who doesn&#39;t want to get ice cream from a food truck that&#39;s parked INDOORS?!  The lady who served us and was kind enough to let us sample some flavors definitely deserves a shoutout. Thanks boo for being so patient with us! My friend LOVED the strawberry basil (if you&#39;re into that minty vibe...not me though). I absolutely fell for the horchata because I am a cinnamon lover! I also liked my tasting for the 408. HELLZ YEAH makes me proud to be a Bay girl. As a lover of ethnic flavors, I had higher expectations for the Ube flavor, but it was straightup  vanilla to me. Eventually I felt too embarrassed to ask for more tastings, so I settled for Horchata. BUT I would love to try the other cool flavors like avocado, mango slice, E.T. and honey lavender! I AM ALL ABOUT THAT EXOTIC LIFE.  The pricing is a bit high for my preference, but I would definitely come back to take my friends who haven&#39;t been here yet! And if we do come back I&#39;d be all up in that karaoke business!  
                  Treatbot, the chrome ice cream truck well-known in San Jose and Silicon Valley for its karaoke machine, finally has a fixed outpost at San Pedro Square Market. Instead of a bricks-and-mortar stand, however, the Treatbot Factory operates endearingly out of an actual truck, tucked away in one corner of the building. Familiar flavors like 408, horchata, and taro remain, and they still have karaoke, although only on certain nights of the week.  The ice cream itself is highly enjoyable, service is always warm and friendly, and it&#39;s great to see more good food trucks establishing actual fixed, physical outlets. As a San Jose resident who jumps at every opportunity to eat, drink, and hang out in far livelier San Francisco, I&#39;m glad to see that Treatbot, along with the rest of San Pedro Square, is part of a slowly growing mix of high-quality, locally-flavored businesses right here in Silicon Valley.  
                  Nice smooth creamy ice cream. What makes this place special are the different flavors they make. I tried thai ice tea and black sesame. The flavors were spot on but not overpowering. I&#39;d definitely come back to try their other flavors.  
                  This place never stops amazing me with their new concoctions. I fell in love when they had the plum and peach sorbet, but more recently they had a siracha spree and made a chili siracha mango, siracha chocolate caramel, and my all time favorite flavor: taro (ube)!  Definitely worth the try and you should always get the double scoop to split with friends &amp; try extra flavors. It might be a little pricey but the flavor is on point and texture is always smooth.  
                  I always go back, hoping that they&#39;ll have the honey lavender flavor. The last few times I&#39;ve gone, they didn&#39;t have the lavender flavor that day. My friend tried the horchata this time, with a mexican chocolate cone. I was so excited when they had the lavender flavor.   A guy took my friend&#39;s order, and her ice cream cone was only $4. When I ordered my cone, a woman stepped up. Afterwards, she asked if I wanted it &#39;for here&#39; or &#39;to go&#39;.  That totally threw me off. Did it make a difference? Yes, she said, there&#39;s a tax difference. So I told her &#39;for here&#39; and was charged an extra $0.35 for my cone. Seriously? That really put me off, especially as the guys working in the truck laughed at the woman for being nit picky about that detail. Even though it&#39;s less than half a dollar, I didn&#39;t like the &#39;special&#39; treatment I was given.   I was in an even worse mood when I sat down, far away from the truck, to eat my ice cream cone. They got the flavor wrong. They had given me purple yam instead of the lavender flavor. The purple yam tasted a lot like yam, which is pretty sweet. It didn&#39;t settle with me well, but I hurriedly ate it all and left. I won&#39;t be going back anytime soon.  
                  Their coconut ice cream is amazing!! Super duper delicious and same with the horchata. I love the little spoons they give us as well, super adorable. The ice cream store is a truck  inside San Pedro square! I was super surprised when I saw it, but its adorable.  
                  Kind if a tricky ice cream truck to find because I was originally trying to locate the karaoke truck but I found the &#34;store&#34; inside of the San Pedro Market instead. The staff was super friendly which is a plus and there was no extra long line. Because it was my first time I asked the employees if I could try the 408 because people were raving about how good it was. I also wanted the try the banana jackfruit sorbet because I love jackfruit. It was not that great so I didn&#39;t get that particular flavor. I finally settled for two scoops which was a total of $5. Not bad at all. The scoops were HUGE!   Ube - It was not too sweet. There were some ice crystals in it or idk what it was that had some weird icy crystal crunch.   408 - Ice cream with caramel and Oreos... How does life get any better? It was so addicting and I finished this scoop in less than 5 mins. It is kind of sweet because it does have caramel but I have a major sweet tooth.   I would defiantly come back and maybe try the ice cream cookie sandwich next time. Also because the staff is stupendous and made me feel so welcome.  
                  Mm Treatbot! This gem can be found inside San Pedro Market Square. The ice cream is served to you from a vintage looking ice cream truck parked in the corner, inside the building. Being a first timer I sampled 3 or 4 flavors before landing on Jackfruit, which is seasonal. There were delicious chunks of jackfruit in the ice cream. The ice cream was perfectly creamy, not too sweet, and bursting with flavor! Did not taste in anyway artificial! I almost got two scoops, with the other scoop being horchata but that will have to be for next time... The horchata is amazing!
