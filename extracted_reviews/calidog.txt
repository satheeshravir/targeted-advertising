                  I&#39;m really picky about my hot dogs, I always read about all the crap they put into them and so I&#39;ve always tried to stay away from hot dogs of questionable quality.  When I ate at Cali dog, I got QUALITY, and could tell that this was a high quality delicious hot dog. The breakfast dog is too bomb, and the people working there are a riot as well. I&#39;ve never had a gourmet hot dog before but I won&#39;t need to get anything else honestly because this place is so damn good!  
                  So, the reason that sold me on this place out of all the other food joints is that they actually had personality.  I asked them to sell me on why I should eat here and they said...&#34;we got some of these hotdogs that have stuff on them or you can get them plain. There are also these potato things that we cut up really thin and fry, but we don&#39;t really know what they are called..&#34;  The also told me they have some bomb bottle water or I could just get the tap water for free!  Loving the attitudes! Good job Calidog.  I ordered the Calidog and Sriranch fries.  
                  I always come here to order the Cali Dog and the srirancha tots and they are always so delightfully delicious! The seaweed and the sauce and everything just blend in so well with the hot dog!  And of course I can&#39;t resist tator tots with srirancha sauce on them.  Sriracha + ranch = best combo ever!  This is always an option for me when I come to San Pedro.  Love it!  
                  If your&#39;e vegetarian - they have a soy-based hotdog!   Also Check-in to get 10% off!  The soy hot dog looks like a real sauasage... I was a little nervous to eat it at first, but I had a carnivore taste test it for me real quick before I took a bite! Overall it was pretty good! I had another soy hotdog earlier this summer in Portland and it had a similar taste (interesting texture, only to get overwhelmed by the strong taste of sauerkraut).   I recommend giving it a try if you&#39;re a curious vegetarian. It&#39;s a pretty interesting experience and I may come back at some point to try some of their &#34;premium&#34; toppings. Grab one and go sit outside in the outdoor seating area!  
                  TL;DR: Great for snacks. Good tots. Good fries.   This is a nice place to visit if you&#39;re just looking for something small to snack on while you&#39;re in San Pedro Square.   While I haven&#39;t had a hot dog yet, I am a big proponent of their fries and tater tots. They have a small selection unique toppings. I&#39;m a fan of their Breakfast Tater Tots. Crispy tots with white gravy and scrambled eggs on top! Bacon for an extra $3. Their mini corn dogs are so pretty good as well.   I also appreciate their selection of mustards; there are bottles of deli style, whole grain, and Dijon on the side once you get your food.  
                  So my problem might not be CaliDog&#39;s fault, but more just a twist of fate... But the whole time I was eating here, I couldn&#39;t help but think about my trip to Vancouver and eating at Japadog. I couldn&#39;t stop comparing, because honestly... it was very similar.   Flavor-wise, spot on. The seaweed, with seasame seeds gave a great crunchy/salty contrast to the carmalized onions and japanese mayo.   But the hot dog didn&#39;t have &#34;snap&#34;... and wasn&#39;t that hot.   The bun, although toasted, felt like it was made of wonderbread, and was mushy.   Apart from Japadog, I might have gone a little easier on it... but Calidog just seemed to pale as Japadog&#39;s ghost haunted my tastebuds.  
                  Pros: Located at trendy spot. Pricing reasonable. Wait time was short/ quick.   Cons: hot dog portion quite small.. hotdog was quite salty.   Overall, mediocre experience. :\  
                  What&#39;s bacon jam? Is that like toe jam?  Okay I&#39;m being gross, but the bacon jam looked like spit up Bacon on my bun.  The CaliDog itself was rather tasty. It had a very Asian ramen flavor to it, which sounds weird, but it works with this hot dog.  This hot dog was on the pricey side, but it was a good try.  10% discount given for a Yelp check-in.  
                  Simply the best!!! If you ever go here expect nothing but professional and compassionate service. They truly care about each guest having a nice hot dog experience.   Thank you for reading :-)  
                  I ordered the CaliDog bunless, and it was alright. The sausage was a little salty for my tastes, but the sauces paired well! The srirancha fries were delicious! My friends nearly stole all of them, despite me ordering a large. I wish they put more sauce on the fries though.  
                  12:47pm/66°F sunny  Purpose: Drove down to get a contract ink, new opening in the south bay. Afterwards I was starving headed over San Pedro Square. Every eatery spot had long wait time due to peak lunch hour. I was impatient, looking for place with shortest line. That&#39;ll be what I&#39;ll eat from, press for time on the go.  Ambiance: Located inside San Pedro Square market share with many other eateries. CD was all the way in the inner back were you can&#39;t go any further. There wasn&#39;t anyone in line or standing nearby, looks deserted. I went up to see if they were close or open just, then couple of people started forming line. Nothing much to say about CD just a place that sells hot dogs of various kinds. Mini beverage fridge, iPad, tip jar, menu holder, specials of day posted. Back area heatlamp for food, prep counter, janitorial supplies, sink, towels dispenser.   Staff: A guy about mid 20s looks like he wanted to fight someone. Didn&#39;t make eye contact with me as, I thought it was odd. I don&#39;t know or seen him before. Realized it wasn&#39;t just me as he did that to others as well.  He seems piss and upset about something. That something, I don&#39;t know and certainly don&#39;t want to know. The whole deal feels weird when someone does that. Word to the wise, I know you don&#39;t want to be there, but bills have to be pay.  Cleanliness: Grade A, impeccable. Kept to its standarda. Servsafe certification posted along with SJ mandate health score.   Eats/Drinks: Shaking dog $7.50 seems a lot to pay for a dog less than a foot long. I was pretty excited that the pictures looks good. Upon receiving it that wasn&#39;t the case. Here&#39;s my findings about CD. They use simple cheap out of package standard buns.  No effort to grilled, toast, or warm it up, it was like biting into a 3M sponge pad bland and flavorless. Listed ingredients were there as, I was more concerned about the meat part. Vietnamese shaking beef were sizzling hot and delicious resting on top of kobe beef dog. Flavors were there and portions for the meat is excellent. Not a bad deal considering time and preparation to cook beef. Could&#39;ve have use the time waiting for beef to finish cooking. Use it on grilling/toasting my buns heh buddy?  Main Features: Claims their breakfast and Shaking dog are best sellers. It also happens to be the most priciest on list. Go figure!  Products/Services: Plain dogs-american, smoked bratwurst, smoked kielbasa, jalapeño pepper jack, Louisiana hot, turkey frank, veggie dog are all $5. Mini chicken corndog ranges from 5-20pc. Signature dogs-calidog $.6.5, chili $6.5, street $7, western $7, shaking $7.5, breakfast $8. Fresh cut fries one size from $3-4.5. Bottle cold drinks $2-2.5, fresh lemonade $3-3.5. Can sodas $1.50. Find them on FB, twitter, Instagram and Yelp. Catering and special events available. Check in with yelp and safe 10% off order.  Punch Lines: Pricey, takes plastic, snooty staff, vibrating pager, shaking beef tasty, spotty service, share seating, styrofoam use, cold hard buns, nothing out of the ordinary, a twist on traditional favorite, off putting, loud and busy (seating area).   Tradeoffs: For over $8 after taxes you&#39;re better off going to Weinerschnitzel. Get 5-6 dogs at $1.59 each with warmer buns, still have chump change left.  Final Thoughts: I&#39;ll admit, I fell for CD without reading others review. For that, I pay dearly with wallet. No wonder during peak hour this place was so dead. Other places have well over 15 people lining up and more walking up. Pictures also shows different buns used to that of actual type. This experience left me hungry and $8 poorer. Not a good deal by a long shot. Going with 2.5 stars.  
                  I&#39;m not big on hot dogs, but this place was calling my name. The gal at the register was friendly and patient with me when it came to figuring out what I wanted to order. I customized my own dog. I got a jalapeño sausage dog wrapped in bacon, with grilled onions and topped with jalapeños. It was delicious down to the very last bite. No more plain boring dogs for me. I will definitely return and try some of their signature dogs. I do recommend this spot to any hot dog or sausage lovers.  
                  1st impression ..... awesome!  I rarely give 4 stars after 1 visit, but these guys impressed me!  I got the American Kobe beef hot dog. 1st bite, best hot dog I have ever tasted!  Service was fast &amp; friendly, we were during there&#34;off&#34; hours, about 230pm. They have a pager that lets you know when order is ready. I&#39;m sure they get busy!  Clean, open kitchen.  I&#39;be back!  Check in for 15% off!  
                  4 stars for the BreakfastDog &amp; bacon jam, but 2 stars for the fries. The food here is a little pricey, but at least you get 10% by checking in on Yelp. There was only a short line around 7pm on a Friday, and it took about 10 minutes to get my order:  -BreakfastDog (House Made Bacon Jam, Bratwurst, Bacon Topped w/Over Easy Egg and House Made Gravy, $8) &amp; SriRanchaFries (w/Sriracha, Ranch &amp; Cilantro, $4) [ yelp.com/biz_photos/cali… : I actually ordered the Breakfast dog without gravy on it, which was perfect for me since I don&#39;t like gravy, and it wasn&#39;t as messy to eat. The bacon jam really made the hot dog, since it was a perfect combination of sweet and savory, and I would definitely order this hot dog again and also consider getting a jar of bacon jam (which they sell). However, I was a little annoyed that my egg was overcooked. The fries on the other hand were very bland/boring side, and I wouldn&#39;t order these again.  Overall, I will definitely be back for my breakfast dog and more bacon jam, but skip the fries.  
                  Great!  Delicious chili cheese fries great hot dog and friendly service.   Thank goodness cuz the fried place near by sucks.  
                  This place has catered at my work before, but this is my first time actually visiting the store. Paid with paypal and received $5 off the signature Cali Dog, so that was a sweet deal.  I love the fried crispy seaweed and teriyaki onion topping. It is a bit pricey, but I think the signature Cali Dog is worth trying at least once.  
                  $7.15 for a hot dog? Really?! If it wasn&#39;t for the 10% Yelp Check in discount, I would have passed on this place. I&#39;m a sucker for discounts.   Ordered the Cali Dog, which is a Kobe beef hot dog, covered with grilled onions, Japanese mayo, Nori and the SriRancha fries and let me tell you, it was a HIT! The whole time I was thinking, &#34;Damn, I can make this at home for half the price&#34; . . . so we went straight to the Japanese grocery store to buy the ingredients and made our own. Unfortunately, it didn&#39;t taste the same . . . until then, I&#39;ll keep coming back until I can perfect mine!  
                  My best friend and I gave this place a shto one evening while we were out and about doing shenanigans, and she REALLY wanted to try this place out, so we did.  My only complaint about this place to be frank (insert hot dog joke here), which seems to be everyones complaint; is the price. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it tasted pretty darn good. I got the Calidog, which was actually tasty! The Garlic fries were also good that I ordered on the side.   In terms of seating, since this is located in San Pedro Square, on busy evenings like Friday and Saturday, or on game nights or main event nights, seating can be a struggle. My best friend and I had to stand somewhere random. Perhaps Calidog could at some point get it&#39;s own little seating area if possible.  Overall; It is expensive, but it is good quality. Something to try out once. Seating is an issue on busy nights. Service wasn&#39;t anything special.  
                  Located inside of SPSM, there is a gourmet hot dog and fries spot. They have unique toppings and combinations for their dogs, but for some reason I have never been inclined to try a hot dog that costs more than 5 bucks. So why the 5 stars? Well that&#39;s for their french fries. I usually go for the SriRancha Fries which is a large basket of fries topped with Sriracha, ranch and cilantro. Their fries are always perfectly crunchy and that sauce definitely has crack in it because it is really difficult for me to even be willing to share that stuff. However, one basket is plenty to share ...if you feel like it. Overall, if you are looking for some good snacks definitely go to CaliDog for gourmet fries.  
                  Wow.  Hot dogs not my 1st choice for a meal ever. This place is exceptionally good. Service was friendly Keri was professional and happy, i feel is important and the food came out hot and within 10-15 min. Worth the wait. We had the breakfast dog. I have a new favorite breakfast meal. The chili dog not from a can and the bun did not fall apart and toasted to perfection.  Fries fresh and hot not frozen!   So all in all here is my rating out of 5 possible points  Service-2.5 Food-2.5  Try it you won&#39;t be disappointed.  
                  Having been drinking in San Pedro Square so many times, I&#39;m surprised I haven&#39;t tried all the food places here! Wanting to grab some food and drinks before the Sharks game, my friend and I headed over CaliDog for hot dogs and San Pedro Market Bar for beers. Since it was my first time, I decided to get the CaliDog ($8). I knew I made the right choice when my friend told me that was what he was ordering too!  Topped with grilled onions, Japanese mayo, seaweed, and some chili flakes, the hot dog was a party in my mouth with every bite. I love how soft and fluffy the bread was! Although the hot dog didn&#39;t have the outer *crunch/snap* like the hot dogs at Original Gravity, this hot dog was still pretty satisfying.  We also ordered the Sriracha Fries. I was pretty excited cause I love Sriracha. The fries were like a crappier version of In N Out fries drizzled with a Sriracha-based sauce drizzled on top. I&#39;d probably skip these next time!  
                  CaliDog was our first stop in San Jose and the highlight of our trip. We could have passed the whole day trying different beers and feasting on outstanding sausages. The duck fat fries were oh so good. Members of staff were stellar. We arrived early on a Saturday with a list of local bars and restaurants to check out throughout the day. Tara (working the bar) suggested additional stops, and later Chris took the time to write a list and even map some spots for us. With fantastic food, beer, and service, CaliDog exceeded our high expectations. We would return to San Jose just to hang out here!  
                  The CaliDog has got to be the ugliest hot dog I have ever seen in my life. Someone not sober decided seaweed on top of a hot dog sounded like a great idea--and it is! With the mayonnaise and teriyaki sauce mixed beneath it, and substitute the Kobe beef link for a bratwurst--this satisfied my need for fusion food this time.  
                  Looks like the CaliDog folks in San Pedro Square have gone mobile. They have a selection of their dogs and fries and some other items. Went with the Western Dog which had bacon wrapped dog, onion strings, and bbq sauce. Also tried a solid chili cheese fries and chicken corn dog nuggets. Definitely hit the spot.  
                  This place is awesome! Nice guys, quick service, franks always perfect, all at a great price. Two franks and a coke for $4.90, where else do you get that. Franks are fresh, and you get served in a minute. If you want a great, quick, delicious snack, this is the place.  
                  I really really like this place! Whenever I want a quick bite downtown, this is my go-to. Sure, it&#39;s $6 for a hot dog. But! IT&#39;S A GOOD HOT DOG. Love that Calidog man! Them sauteed onions with that seaweed and that not overly thick bun. Definitely one of the more gourmet hot dogs I&#39;ve had, and I&#39;m glad to have it so close to my workplace downtown! I&#39;m not a big fan of asian fusion a majority of the time, but this is definitely an exception!  Plus, there&#39;s free two hour parking for the San Pedro Market Square with validation! So why the heck not?!?  
                  I wish I could give this place 3 and a half stars! Located within San pedro square, it is probably the only place I would go to for hot dogs in downtown San Jose. They also serve a veggie dog which is not spectacular but not too bad either. Usually go for the Turkey dog with the fried egg etc.   Their sriracha fries are awesome!  
                  If we were just rating the food, this place is pretty good. It&#39;s definitely a solid hot dog- as far as hot dogs can go. The first time I went I just got one of the basic dogs, but loaded with condiments it was pretty good. The fries were better, pretty bomb, we couldn&#39;t decide between the chili ones or the Sriracha ones. We decided on the chili, but the guy gave us the Sriracha ranch sauce anyways. Pretty sure it is literally just a mixture of Sriracha and ranch, but it was good.   One of the people in my group messed up her Paypal when she paid, and the manager came running out to find us so he could deliver a free lemonade. My friend thought the lemon was too sour, but it was definitely fresh and I thought it still tasted pretty good.   Just like everyone else said, the problem is the price. You are definitely paying for a good piece of meat, I&#39;m just still too broke to be paying that much for a hot dog. People pay just as much for the dogs at Pink&#39;s in LA, which isn&#39;t nearly as good as CaliDog is. Thinking about it, $5-$7 for a meal really isn&#39;t THAT bad (and it does fill you up), but there is this weird mental thing we&#39;ve all been programmed to where paying that much for hot dogs just seems ... wrong.  
                  I&#39;m vegetarian so I got a veggie dog - did not like it at all. However, the fries with the creamy sriracha sauce was amazing! My friend had a hot dog too and also just thought it was okay.  
                  The Seattle Dogs at CaliDog are really good!!!  CaliDog has a very eclectic menu featuring fusion variations on the standard hot dog.  I go there often, and I&#39;ve enjoyed their signature CaliDog, their BreakfastDog and their AmericanKobeDog.  These guys never disappoint.  Their fries are delicious and come with a wide variety of toppings to choose from.  I looked over their large menu again on afternoon, and I asked them if they could make me a Seattle Dog: cream cheese slathered on a toasted bun, topped with a grilled hot dog, and smothered in grilled onions.  They didn&#39;t happen to stock cream cheese at that time, but they said they would give Seattle Dogs a go.  About a week later, I came back and they made me a brilliant Seattle Dog.  It was so good!!!  Now I&#39;m watching my carbs, so today they served my Seattle Dog on a bed of arugula, dressed lightly with their vinaigrette, instead of the bun.  It was even better than the first one!  If you prefer more grilled onions, or less, or ask for other modifications, they are more than happy to accommodate you.  The Seattle Dog is not yet on their menu, but you only have to ask for it.  I highly recommend CaliDog!  Give their new Seattle Dogs a try.  
                  First time and certainly not my last!  Calidog is located deep inside market. You can park across  the street and get validation.  My friend and I got the cali dog. The hot dog was juicy and the toppings that on top of the calidog complemented the hotdog nicely. On top of the Calidog, was nori (seaweed), sauteed onions, sesame, and drizzled with teriyaki sauce.  
                  Last time I came, they ran out of Kobe beef so got a Louisiana hot sausage dog. It was ok, nothing special.  This time I was determined to try the Kobe beef so went here early. I got the StreetDog and it tasted like a normal sausage. It had Kobe Beef which I couldn&#39;t really tell the difference from a normal beef sausage, grilled onions and I skipped the bacon.   They got free condiments like sauerkraut, relish, raw onions, mustard, and ketchup.  Prices are ok. Around $7-9 for normal tasting dog.  
                  The CaliDog is really good. I liked it a lot. It&#39;s topped with nori! Totally different from any hotdog&#39;s I&#39;ve ever tried. I thought it would taste weird but I was surprised how tasty it was. I also tried a bit of the breakfast dog and... mmm forgot what the third one is called but both were also tasty. But I liked the CaliDog best.  
                  Some real tasty hot dogs of all varieties.  I&#39;d highly recommend the Louisiana Hot Sausage based on the premise of flavor alone.  Lots of custom topping options, and other small bites.  Normal dogs will run you around five dollars, and fully loaded options will run you around seven dollars.  The flavor packs a punch, they have something for everyone&#39;s tastes, and they definitely know how to do a dog right.  Only drawback would be the slightly steeper pricing.  
                  I came here with my boyfriend for lunch while we were walking around the square. I got the calidog and their breakfast tots. The calidog was very good. I loved the Asian inspiration on this and the mixture is unique and delicious. I was most looking forward to the tots that were loaded with eggs and gravy. They were yummy but a little more bland than I would like. So tots, you let me down a little but would still definitely come back to try their other dogs.  
                  I come here every so often to grab a quick bite for lunch and the dogs here are pretty tasty! Plus, if you use your Paypal app to pay, usually there&#39;s some sort of discount offer on it! Last time I used the app I got $3 off $8!   I really like the idea of the CaliDog with the mayo and seaweed. Yum! However, I didn&#39;t really enjoy their ChiliDog (came out a little cold for some reason) and their garlic fries were a little bit too oily for my liking. Every time I come here, their Bacon Jam sign is up but they&#39;re always sold out! Super curious about what that tastes like, so I&#39;m probably going to try their Breakfast Dog next since they have some bacon jam in it... :D   I guess my only gripe here is that they do take pretty long to get your order ready (I mean really? How long does it take to make a hot dog?!) which is why they hand you one of those coaster buzzer thingies. Price wise, they&#39;ll charge you between $6-8 a dog which is pretty expensive but with the Paypal discount, it turns out to be a really good deal!  
                  I&#39;d give this a 3 1/2 as a rating. I had the calidog and sri ranch fries. It was okay. The fries were nice and crispy ( which is a plus) but the seasoning and sauce on top could&#39;ve been better. I was expecting them to put more of the drizzle of the sri ranch but they went as minimal as they can. Not impressed. But the calidog, in the other hand, was better than the fries itself due to its thoughtful flavoring. I think the seaweed is abit soggy; I wished it was a nice dry crispy texture instead. Honestly, I think I can make a better version than this hot dog. I actually made a japanese style hot dog before by hands and the one I made was pretty good. Compared to this, I don&#39;t think it would compare to mine. Lol. But anyway, good job, Calidog. You&#39;ve tried to impress me.  
                  I am not too crazy about hot dogs at all, but they have so many varieties that it keeps things interesting. I love their sirancha fries!  
                  These hot weenies are not your average Home Depot, $1.50 Costco not even your NY style-outside-on-the-street styled hot dogs. They&#39;re a class of their own because they are CALIdogs and apparently the word cali in calidogs means AsianDogs because their signature cali dog is a hot dog with strips of seaweed on top sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds. The appeal is high but the taste of the product itself was a flat ok.   Still not better than the $1.50 Costco hot dog that comes with a drink. It is however, better than the Ikea hot dog.   I also tried the chili cheese dog which I ended up getting for free because they messed up on my order. That made me cheese. WIN WIN. So cool points for the cool workers who didn&#39;t toss the messed up order.   Best thing about this joint is the location. Nothing hipper right now than San Pedro Square.  
                  I&#39;ve only had the Breakfast Dog, but if that&#39;s not a 5 Star hot dog, you&#39;re a liar and I can&#39;t have you in my life.  
                  A nice alternative to the expensive booths in San Pedro square market.   Im normally not a hotdog person but I decided to give it a try and was pleasantly surprised. I got their Cali dog, which was a Japanese infused hot dog, which has a really nice crispness due to the seaweed flakes. That being said, don&#39;t inhale accidentally while eating or you WILL suck up the flakes and it WILL hurt. But that was my fault - nothing wrong with this tasty hot dog place.  
                  I came here during my break from volunteering at the SJ Jazz Fest last Friday.  I wanted something convenient and near by, and CaliDog caught my eye.  I also wanted something spicy, so the lady behind the counter recommended the JjigaeDog Bratwurst.  I thought it was weird that it was topped with spicy stewed kimchi and diced spam, but it turned out really good!  Just the right amount of spiciness and a whole lot of Bratwurst.  The only thing I would change is the spam and bread.  The spam was way too salty, maybe use spam with less sodium?  As for the bread, I would use a hearty thicker bread.  
                  Pros  Creativity: the breakfast dog is the best put together hot dog I&#39;ve had just because it&#39;s both sweet an savory. The breakfast dog is topped with bacon, jam, and deep fried egg. As you bite in, the egg yolk runs down making it even more special. And the garlic fries are hella bomb too.  Service: the guys taking and making the orders are chill and fast with fast with orders.   Cons:  The other toppings and hotdogs were alright and prices have gone up, which sucks when you wanna try a little of everything in San Pedro square on a budget.  
                  It&#39;s a good place to grab a normal hotdog or something you don&#39;t quite expect. While they have plain dogs (kobe, bratwurst, pork, etc. for about $5), they also have special dogs with pork chili or fried egg and bacon jam (ranging from $7 to $9). They also have  a variety of fries.   I&#39;m not a huge hotdog fan but sometimes I get the craving. Fortunately, it&#39;s not your typical hotdog. I ordered a plain bratwurst for my mom and I had the breakfast dog (bratwurst topped with bacon jam and an over easy egg, house gravy on the side). The bratwurst had a nice snap and the bacon jam was deliciously sweet and salty.   If the other special dogs are as good as the breakfast dog I will not be disappointed. I have my eye on their chili cheese dog and fries.  
                  (: Boba-Foodholic Says :)  My friend took me here to try out something good, so we went there on the weekend. We ordered Breakfast Dog, CaliDog, and Garlic Fries. It was kinda expensive but it was really good because I never tried it before and it was something new. I especially like the bacon jam inside the breakfast dog, which I made myself at home, but didn&#39;t taste the same. I would definitely go back for more :)  
                  I come to San Pedro Market basically every Sunday lately and I always have to get the Breakfast Dog. One of the best things for me personally since I love bacon, sausage and eggs! You can&#39;t beat it.  I&#39;m a little afraid to try the Salsa dog since I don&#39;t know how well the combo of fish and sausage go together but one day, I&#39;ll have enough Mimosas, and go for it! The minus 1 star is that a lot of the time they disappear randomly and I can&#39;t order my food and have to go somewhere else... but then appear 15 minutes later. Argh!  
                  Probably my favorite &#39;gourmet/fusion&#39; hot dog i&#39;ve had. I would only pay 6.50 for a dog here, and no where else. Had to try the Cali dog, so both my GF &amp; I ordered one, with a Srirancha fry to go with it.   The calidog was delicioussssss. A delicious, fresh tasting dog, that doesn&#39;t taste like it has a ton a nitrates/nitrites/preservatives (they very well may have some but I didn&#39;t taste it), generously topped with seaweed and teriyaki onions. The fries were alright, nothing to die for, probably won&#39;t get it again tbh.   If you use the PayPal app and use it as your form as payment, you can get $5 off, this time around their PayPal merchant system didn&#39;t work, so wasn&#39;t able to take advantage of the coupon. Next time!   Will definitely be back again!  
                  Came close to closing so they were out of eggs. Quite Traumatizing- believe it or not. Settled to get the Kelbosa and it was really good. Two thumbs up  
                  I had the Calidog which is the best of the two I&#39;ve eaten. I don&#39;t even remember the other one I ate because I liked mine so much. Unfortunately, when we came today, we asked about the yelp check in deal and the guy said he didn&#39;t know what we were talking about. Sad.  The first calidog I had was so amazing. I think the bun was toasted that time, or maybe the hotdog was a bit charred for an extra level of textures .Unfortunately, today was a bit lackluster, but the generous helping of seaweed and carmelized onions still hit the spot. I hope this place continues to do great stuff!  
                  Okay, first off, the environment in San Pedro Square is really cool. It&#39;s a safe haven for hipsters with The Garage Bar next door and an eclectic mix of eateries. Although, a good point to note is hard to find seating, whether it&#39;s busy or not. Be prepared to stand or scout out a table before ordering maybe.   So I got a veggie dog with random toppings and the SriRancha fries, and my friend got the CaliDog. She said it was okay/good, worth a try. From a vegetarian standpoint, their veggie hot-dog was not that great. The SriRancha fries on the other hand- BOMB. Would definitely go back for those.   Either way, it&#39;s a cool place to try, but not a place I would obsess over.  
                  It seems this place just opened! It&#39;s definitely a cool concept to have Asian fusion take place on the classic hotdog and fries.  While my mom and I were waiting for our meal at Robee&#39;s Falafel to be served we skimmed through CaliDog&#39;s menu. The SriRancha fries caught my eye- I mean who doesn&#39;t love Ranch, Sriracha or french fries? And this item has ALL 3!  A bit pricey for fries and my mom seemed a bit hesitant, but she went with it. As we sat down and started eating our meal, I noticed she started to solely eat the fries. They&#39;re crisp, spicy and savory. It&#39;s definitely not just Sriracha and Ranch thrown on top, they&#39;re tossed in sauce yet still contains it&#39;s crunch. Totally addicting.   My mom eating french fries? That says a lot, since she&#39;s a rice and pasta person.  Can&#39;t wait to come back to get more of their fries and try their Kobe Hotdog or Kurobuta Bratwurst!  
                  Hot diggity, dog diggity, ohh what you do to me CaliDog!  Located in SPSM, arguably SJ&#39;s only foodie destination, CD has a dog for you. From discerning palates to vegans to the nibblets, there&#39;s a little something for everyone as they like to say.   And these are not your run of the mill, durty water, hoofs n snouts filled kinda dogs...we&#39;re talking Kobe beef, Brats, chorizo snausage or hickory smoked meatless pups.    Then there&#39;s the toppings...from the perfunctory mustard, onions &amp; sauerkraut to the more adventurous seaweed, eggs or bacon jam. FTW!!!  All dogs then get nestled into a specially baked bun.   And don&#39;t miss the Srirancha fries which are the money shot of fried potatoes!  And of course they offer MexiCola to wash it all down.  
                  Not all dogs are created equally....I love Calidog!  I love them so much i&#39;ve tried all their samples already and even have Calidog gear! =) Their shaken beef dog is my favorite- beef on beef!  I can eat this everyday of my life!  They also have other creative delicious dogs and some of my other favorites are the Calidog, Chili Dog, &amp; Breakfast Dog! I can eat a bowl of chili from the chili dog by itself and the chili is super good on top of fries as well!  If you haven&#39;t had the chance to check them out, you should def make a point to do so.  They are located in the bustling San Pedro Square Market.  Oh- and i think the CaliDog chicks are hot! =)  
                  This ain&#39;t your classic hot dog stand and that&#39;s a great thing!  Came here after hearing rumors of a seaweed hotdog that I just HAD to have. Turns out their signature dish, the CaliDog, is a Japanese inspired dog topped with teriyaki sauce, Japanese mayo, seaweed and chili powder. Yes, it sounds unusual, but it really works! The toppings enhance, not undermine, the quality hotdog it sits on top. Each bite gives you a symphony of salty, sweet with a hint of spice.   I&#39;ve also tried their bacon wrapped dog because how can I not try it after knowing it exists! It was all I dreamed it would be. Bite into the crunchy bacon and hear the snap of the hotdog casing sends shivers down my spine! I ate this with the garlic fries and I couldn&#39;t speak to anyone all day. The garlic is seriously potent. Don&#39;t order this for lunch &amp; return to work afterwards because your coworkers will hate you.   If you&#39;re a Bratwurst fan, CDs is great paired with a beer from the Market Bar. If you love Siracha, their Siracha fries will make you happy!  
                  This place often gets looked over by passerbys before game time... as least so I&#39;ve noticed.  I almost always pick up a pie right across from this place so I&#39;ve looked past this spot a few times myself.   I have tried the kobe beef dog in the past. It just tastes like a plain ol&#39; hot dog. Nothing to knock em for though. I&#39;d rate that a 3/5.  I also tried the chili cheese fries recently. I actually stumbled upon this place since Little Chef Counter said their short rib fries would take 25 minutes! No way was I going to be late to the game over some fries! The chili was strange... but strange in a good way. It had a hint of curry in it, which I LOVED! The fries were crispy despite being covered in chili. I&#39;d rate it a 4/5 for being a little out of the ordinary. Delish! Would order again.   I&#39;ll have to come back to try the SriRANCHa fries!  
                  I just returned and tried the CaliDog: kobe beef hot dog on a bun with teriyaki onions, crispy seaweed and Japanese mayo. This was phenomenal. It was one of the best hot dogs I&#39;ve ever had. It was seriously good.  I also ordered the SriRancha fries (fries coated in a sauce of sriracha and ranch. These were pretty good but not the best. First, the fries are tossed in the sauce like wings. What this does is 1. cool the fries to room temperature and 2. dilute the flavor or all three (fries, ranch and sriracha). I would rather have the fries served hot right out of the fryer and drizzled with sriracha and mayo and topped with green onion. I think this would make the flavors pop and the fries won&#39;t be limp.  I think this place is so close to perfection but just needs to execute the food a little better then it will be perfect.  I&#39;m so glad that fancy hot dogs are the new hot food item.  
                  If you want a plain dog this is your place or if you&#39;re wanting something fancier you can make your own or choose one of their specialties.   I&#39;m a fan of the Smoked Bratwurst and their garlic fries are absolutely yummy and not to be missed  
                  Just overpriced hot dogs.  Nothing extremely unique about thier food.  It&#39;s nice that there are condiments such as sauerkraut,  relish, onions, ketchup and mustard.   Use the PayPal app. First purchase you get $5.00 off (which is the price of a whole dog).  
                  Just tried the Calidog truck at Milpitas Street Eats. I&#39;m not usually a big hot dog guy but you know how every now and then you just want a dog. :). Anyways. My wife and I have started going to these food truck events cause we have found the offerings to be awesome and stuff that you can&#39;t get elsewhere.   I went to the Calidog truck and my wife got Hungry Kong.  I just hot a regular beef hot dog with bacon wrapped around it.   It was a good size and crazy delicious!  I was gonna put some mustard and fixings but then I took a bite plain just to taste it and ended up just eating it all up. It was great.  Very flavorful without the need for any condiments.   Well. These food trucks are definitely winning me over!!!  
                  Over priced hotdogs. Plain dog is $5, each topping is $.50-1.00 extra. Cashier had bad attitude and manager is clueless. Refused to honor Yelp offer, even though it was for this location and my order was eligible according to their rules. Told me flat out they simply don&#39;t take Yelp. What a joke. Update: CaliDog contacted me and promised to improve customer service. Hope they do it. I will check it out.  
                  I&#39;m surprised I forgot to review this place already. I find myself in San Pedro Market Square about once a week, and outside of the Bar and Market Beer, Calidog is my usual go to.   So what makes Calidog worth picking up over the plethora of other food options? Well brats and beer are a staple. And these are some damn good dogs.   First time I recommend getting the Calidog. This was recommended to me and my friend and we both agreed it was an amazing mix of flavor. The seaweed gives it something new and nice.  The Western Dog, which commemorates their first year, does have bacon on it - which is why I got it. Sadly this was a case of &#34;it works for burgers but not dogs.&#34; I&#39;d say skip it.   I&#39;m still working my way down the list; breakfast dog or Shaking Beef dog will probably be next.   But without fail, get the sriracha fries. So good and worth sharing.  Tip: you can always ask for bacon on any dog. Tip2: they have Sriracha here, which goes great on all dogs.  
                  Yummy fushion hotdogs! I went with the Calidog and SriRancha fries. Om nom nom!!! I swapped the beef frank with a hot link..best decision ever!!! I usually have to have ketchup with my hot dogs, but the Calidog was so flavorful that I decided to go without. The sweetness of the teriyaki sauce was harmonious with the saltiness of the hot link. The SriRancha fries were excellent as well, loved the Sriracha Ranch sauce with shoestring sized fries. I will definitely be back to try their other Signaturedogs.  
                  Tried some samples of CaliDog at a Yelp event in Oakland. They were super nice and let us try as many as we wanted - the sample sizes were pretty big too, a quarter or a third of an entire dog!  I like their flavors &amp; concepts - had: * Cornbread Chilidog - 3 stars  yelp.com/biz_photos/bN_R…  (Chinese infused flavors: 5 spice, stewed tomatoes, kidney beans, red peppers, pork, cheddar cheese, green onions)  * Calidog - 3 stars  yelp.com/biz_photos/bN_R…  (Japanese flavors: roasted seaweed, teri-onion sauce, Japaense mayo, chili heat).  Both were unique in terms of toppings on a dog. But I found the actual hot dogs somewhere between gourmet sausages &amp; your average grocery store oscar mayer wiener. Probably closer to the oscar mayer one.. while they were juicy and cooked just right (you get that little burst of juice when you take a bite), the meat was still pretty homogenous and plain. I would have preferred more variety &amp; uniqueness in the actual meat of their hot dogs. Also, the buns were fairly dry.  
                  Even after several trips to Southern California, I still haven&#39;t been able to try Dog Haus or Slaw Dogs. There was simply not enough time. Though I have never eaten at those places, I knew that the Bay Area lacks the uniqueness and insane combinations when it comes to hot dogs. When I viewed CaliDog&#39;s menu, I was excited to try it.   I have noticed that this place was closed on what otherwise should be opened. They say &#34;the third&#39;s a charm&#34; which is true in this scenario. Last Friday was my 3rd attempt and I got to order right before the rush.   The menu isn&#39;t extensive and while there are about 5 &#34;unique&#34; hot dogs to choose from, only 1 can count as unique so that was what I ordered: Breakfast Dog. The Breakfast Dog is a brat smothered w/ bacon jam, a piece of bacon, an over easy egg, and gravy. I like the bun that was used.. a hoagie, perhaps? I ate in a dim environment where B2 is located so I can enjoy the live band. I am not sure if orders come w/ fries or if they gave me an extra one but I also ordered a side of Sriracha fries. Yes, SRIRACHA fries.   I can skip the fries next time. The fries were very flimsy and tiny; each piece was very small so I had to eat my fries w/ a fork. I can taste a tad kick of heat to my fries but definitely no hint of Sriracha whatsoever. The Breakfast Dog tasted really good... I could not taste the bacon jam, admittedly and the bacon would be better if it was wrapped around the brat. The gravy and over easy eggs won me. It&#39;s a hot dog so I refused to eat w/ a fork and knife but I can say w/ confidence that if you are out on a date, do not order this particular item; it&#39;s messy as hell. Fortunately, he knows how I eat [haha].   Short plea: the Breakfast Dog is missing tater tots.   Back to my review. The 4 stars is really for the service. I was busy checking in and trying to get pictures taken that I completely missed the 10% off deal but the guy caught it and gave it to me. Something was either wrong w/ my Wells Fargo debit card or something was up w/ his CC swiper thingy but for some reason, my card did not &#34;swipe&#34;. After a few failed attempts, the guy said he will put my order through anyway. I appreciate that.... I thanked him then told him to try punching my debit card # instead of swiping it - success! Who doesn&#39;t want a free meal? But I just did not feel right about it.   Every order is made to order. On the side, there is a small condiment table. It is very clean. You have your ketchup, mustard, relish, and onions. Plastic utensils, cups, and a water dispenser is available if you do not want sodas or those Japanese carbonated drinks that they carry. As I was waiting, the guy that took my ordered checked, grabbed my order, and handed it to me despite the chaos from the line.  Awesome service.  Another San Pedro Square eatery down.  
                  Got their calidog which was fairly tasty. However, the price seemed too high, especially when you consider that all you are really getting is a 50 cent hot dog with some fancy toppings.  Tried once, moving on...  
                  Modern approaches, tasty ingredients, and creative combinations, but the delivery could use a little more character and service needs some polish.  Beer food done fun &amp; exotic, located in the bustling and en vogue setting of San Pedro Square Market. What&#39;s not to like, right? The flavor combinations and ingredients are really good [glutinous] - the signature Japanese-inspired Calidog, Chinese chili, Vietnamese shaking beef, shrimp ceviche; from kitschy takes on Asian tastes to [seems the trend everywhere to do] a breakfast variation - CaliDog offers a decent number of dressed and undressed options. By most considerations, they have all the makings for success and I WANT to enjoy this place more than a 3-star review reflects, but...  For the wealth of toppings ,the hot-dogs &amp; buns are a little lacking as a vehicle where they should be the centerpieces. The hot-dogs are missing that satisfying snap to contrast the tenderness of toppings and the buns more oft have been soggy under all the weight. Bite after [granted, flavorful] bite, there isn&#39;t any difference in textures, there&#39;s no tooth, no gratifying chomp.   Food aside, the more glaring inconsistency seems to be service. From unattended operating hours to overly lengthy waits to simply forgotten orders (happened to us twice in a span of two weekends), I hope these kinks are just a sign of newness and eventually get worked out.  I&#39;ll probably still patronize them (and hopefully find reason to bump this up a star!), because their breakfast dog is really satisfying and I keep going back for it, regardless. _____________________________________ Bratwurst, bacon, sausage, egg, country gravy. Delicious heart-attack on a bun.  
                  I had the SriRancha fries...OMG yum!!!  It lost a start because they were soooooooooo salty., and the service was super slow.  But, they were fresh, and delicious, and the sauce was soo good!  
                  This is a little Fusion Hot Dog stand inside the San Pedro Marketplace, the food court without a shopping mall,  in downtown San Jose.   They have a variety of fusion dogs, most made with &#34;Kobe&#34; beef (except for the pork ones), and an eclectic mix of toppings that are creative in their design, if not perfect in their delivery.   I had the signature Cali Dog, which is a Japanese inspired Kobe beef weiner, covered with grilled teriyaki onion sauce, Japanese mayo, and smothered with crispy dry Nori (Seaweed) bits, with a dash of chili seasoning. I love Nori, was raised on it, but if you weren&#39;t, you might try something else.   The dog was filling, the taste was pretty decent, but it wasn&#39;t cheap...$6.50 for one.  
                  Decided I wanted a hot dog on hot dog day, good gourmet hot dogs, good prices, and the portions are on point.  
                  I was craving a hot dog after seeing a vendor on the street on my way to meet my bf for lunch, so CaliDog it was. I ordered a Louisiana sausage with cheese, grilled onions, and fried onions with a side of garlic fries. I love their higher quality sausages, the Louisiana especially has a really good spicy kick to it. I wish I got just the sausage and the garlic fries to eat without the toppings or bun... The bun was too chewy and the bun to meat ratio was off. The grilled onions were good, but the fried onions were cold and hard. They put shredded cheese on it and it wasn&#39;t melted at all. So I ended up scraping off the toppings and eating it with a fork and one side of the bun. The fries were delicious though! They were crispy in-n-out&#39;esque fries with a ton of garlic on it. I paid $15 for A hot dog, fries, and a water bottle which I feel was pretty pricey. I&#39;d come back, but I&#39;d find a better combination of flavors than I tried today.  
                  Was in the area one day and ran into San Pedro square. This place is awesome! Tons of food venders. Walked around and found a spot called Calidog. Fancy hotdogs, Hmmm that sounds pretty interesting. Looking over the menu the shaking dog caught my eye. I like shaking beef and I like hotdogs. A combo of two things I love. Uh yes please. Few minutes went by and my order was up. What am I looking at.. Savory grilled beef on top of a hotdog? Yes.. It&#39;s amazing. I can&#39;t wait to get back to my table and try this heaven on a bun. Ok here goes, Now you have to take a mega man size bite to get everything in there... The beef, the hotdog, the bun, oh ya and them greens. It a fantastic fusion of savory and comfort food. Bite after bite and I&#39;m still loving it. Yep this place is pretty good. I&#39;m looking forward to trying their other creations when I&#39;m back in town.  
                  Great tasting menu items and the garlic fries were loaded with garlic. They use the same style potatos as In n Out. The service was outstanding.  The only thing that was a negative was the price. $5 for a hot dog before putting anything on it is way too expensive. Unfortunately the pricing structure is not conducive to having a brick and mortar type place. A kiosk makes better sense.  
                  Another food vendor I had to revisit again.   I got a chance to sample Calidog this year at the Yelp Beerwalk Festival this year. I sampled the Shakingdog and enjoyed it. As I was walking around San Pedro Market checking out SJ MADE vendors, I was surprised to see Calidog again! Now, it&#39;s good too see that Calidog has a store front in the San Pedro Market.   I wanted a couple friends of mine to sample the Shakingdog I&#39;ve tasted at the Beerwalk Festival. I also ordered the Calidog since I missed out on this one. The Shakingdog was mounted with a lot shaking beef slices. This dog was full of beefy goodness from beginning to end. PAUSE! As for the Calidog, it was something different for me but had an interesting taste. I&#39;m use to having nori with sushi, but it did go well with this Japanese inspired dog.  As for the verdicts for the dogs between my buddies, the votes were split down the middle. One told the other to, &#34;STEP YOUR PALETTE UP!&#34; I did enjoy both dogs. I should have went back to get that Breakfastdog.  
                  I&#39;ve tried CaliDog a handful of times since they opened at SPSM and my latest visit to CaliDog warrants a positive review. The quality and presentation of their food has improved tremendously. I find their lemonade and customer service to be outstanding, and I&#39;m happy to see that their innovative menu continues to grow. I like their unique SriRancha fries and my kids always enjoy their meals here. Perfect place to hangout w/friends or grab a quick bite before/after a game, concert, show, etc.  
                  It&#39;s hard to find a place that specializes in hot dogs, so when I do, I have to try it. This one was good, but I have trouble giving it that 5 star rating. There was just something missing on the dog.  The buns were oversized and very tasty. The hotdogs were good, but I think I might try one of their sausage next time.   If you&#39;re in the mood for a hot dog, you can&#39;t really go wrong here!  
                  Delicious Calidog!!  Not bad price of $6.50, about same price as in theaters, but much tastier.   They have something like this in Vancouver, canada, so glad I was able to try calidog without having to travel that far.   My only complaint was that the hot dog size was a bit small. I was still hungry after eating one hotdog.  So, guess the price could be cheaper or the hot dog could be a bit bigger.    I will definitely be back to eat another calidog and try something else also! Love that this place exists!!!!!
