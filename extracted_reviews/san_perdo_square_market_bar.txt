                  BEER. BEER. BEER.   Come through here. Try a new beer. Grab some glasses, sit, chill and enjoy the atmosphere of San Pedro Market at night.   Workers here are always extra friendly as well~  
                  Love this bar with the huge mirror. I guess one can be a total voyeur and just sit here at the bar and stare into the mirror looking at people coming and going while being somewhat incognito. By the way, I am not endorsing such behavior.  Came here with a couple of my business associates. For lunch, getting a non-alcoholic drink makes it a bit trickier. I wanted something fruity sans alcohol so asked the bar tender if she can mix a fruity drink and she concocted this really tasty drink from a blend of strawberries, blueberries and pomegranate.  Aside from applauding the creativity of my bartender, the ginormous mirror makes this bar truly magnetic and just draws one right towards it.  
                  I thought it would take forever getting my drink but the guy who helped me out, helped me right when I got to the bar.   I just wanted my girly lemon drop and every bar makes it kinda different. This ones was probably the best one I&#39;ve tried. The guy was fast, efficient, and makes good drinks! So glad I didn&#39;t have to wait long.  
                  Let me start off by saying I love coming here. It&#39;s always such a good time. I will however say I did run into an experience where I was the slightest thrilled. I ordered a drink from the bar which was excellently made and while drinking I realized there was a fly in the middle of my drink. Now I don&#39;t consider myself a complainer, but come on, that&#39;s quite nasty and I must say something to get another drink etc.  So I take my drink back to the bar to alert this girl that worked for the bar. She could careless about what I had to say let alone anything mysterious in my drink. Anyway, I managed to order a drink which was bugless this time. I was dissatisfied with the way the bartender dealt with the situation but this has been he only issue I&#39;ve had while here. I would still go back, but will make sure to stear clear of that bartender.  
                  I&#39;m new to San Jose and hadn&#39;t had a chance to come here until last night. I loved it! I was probably way to happy when I saw it all : ) most food places were closed but the bars were great. They have so many options. I definitely want to come to this place during the day.  Chris A. is amazing!  
                  Was amazed  how  awesome this place is! Definitely  coming back to try the BBQ, seafood, and the desserts place!  
                  Outdoor sitting + drinks + food = yes yes yes!  Food can be better tho I did not really enjoy the food but I&#39;m not deducting any star for that. Weather is perfect here during summer, good place just to relax and chill.  
                  So yeah, service is slow when it&#39;s a friday/saturday night or if there&#39;s a big game on and people buy a drink and just stand around the bar.  Market Bar houses the biggest TV within San Pedro Square and people will crowd around it so it&#39;s hard to grab a drink.  The cool part is that you can buy you drinks and sit anywhere you want (for fans of outdoor drinking).   Pricing is OK...glass of house pinot grigio and a pint (allegash white) will run you $14.   I prefer Garage Bar in the back!  
                  Very chill atmosphere on a Friday night, they got many fine craft brews here. Drinks came pretty fast, bartenders are nice and the vibe was honestly great!  
                  Bar area inside gets super crowded and crazy, plus side is all the room and seating there is outside. On sundays, happy hour is ALLLLLLL DAAAAAAY. literally the perfect place to lounge and drink the entire day.  
                  So starting off with the positives, they spelled prosecco right, unlike the wine bar next door... seriously... porsecco?... ugh.  For a single little pint sized bottle, it was decent prosecco, if not a tad dry. They must not receive many requests for wine, especially on sharks nights, so they don&#39;t keep a bottle open.  I loved! LOVED that I could walk around the space with my glass. The other wine bar wouldn&#39;t let me leave their bar section, so thankfully I walked around until I found the Market Bar which lets me roam to my hearties content.  All in all when I return this will probably be the bar I stop at. There weren&#39;t many if any negatives. The service was friendly and quick and I was happy I was now liquored up enough to deal with the influx of sharks fans... sigh.  
                  Pretty solid night life spot to go to for drinks and food w/ some friends. Def a safe and happening place.  
                  I&#39;m not from the SJ area but I will gladly come just to eat at San Pedro Square Park. A great place to watch sports and to visit when indecisive on what to eat. There are a lot of great options!  
                  Inconsistent pricing. Bought a round of Jameson for $27 for three drinks then the next round went to a different bartender and it was $24.  
                  Always a fun time! The tower of a building going up just down the street from the place is kind of a bummer.  Mainly because it was shading the entire outdoor seating.....but, oh well!  
                  An alright place. You&#39;re in San Pedro Square and want some alcohol? Well it seems like everyone and their long lost grandma&#39;s decided to come here.   To say there is a line here is an understatement. This place gets busy especially on game night. Took us awhile to get our drinks and I&#39;m not a patient man when it comes to dinner time drinks.   Service was decent, but nothing spectacular. Will try to get a drink elsewhere next time, but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ll never come here again.  
                  Reasonably priced drinks and good casual atmosphere.  Bartenders are nice!  you can get your parking validated here!  
                  This is a nice bar in San Pedro Market Square to drink at, once you get past the weakened crowds and make it to the bar itself. Located at the end of the first building, they&#39;ve got a few booths inside along with a bunch of outdoor seating.   Once we made it thru the crowds and caught the attention of one of the 4 bartenders roaming across the bar, we speedily received our delicious drinka. For decent prices.  Any bar in the Square is good by me, it&#39;s so close to every type of food your drunk self will crave!  
                  A bit on the drowsy end for things to do. Bar was lagging and food selection was fair. It&#39;s a cool place to chill on patio. Not a bad place at all, just not somewhere you go for new or exciting.  Needs an overhaul in the amusement department.  
                  I love the market place feel. The market bar had a good vibe because I felt very free to stand around the bar, roam the square, or take a sit outside.   The service was quick, and the beers on tap were delicious. I ordered the allagash curiex! 11% at a whopping 10.00 for craft beer. It had hints of bourbon.   It was a delicious drink and it would be a treat every now and then. I&#39;d definitely come back for more. I look forward to music at the market.  Also the proximity to all the delicious fast food restaurants were major pluses!  
                  I cannot believe I have not yet written a review for this bar!   How to begin....hmmm...  Let&#39;s start with the ambiance! This place is GREAT. Nestled in the heart of San Pedro Square Market, you will find  a full bar with a HUGE mirror placed behind it and hummingbirds floating above you. Bar space is limited, however, there are tables positioned a few feet behind the seating area so that you can stand and still have a place to put your drink!  The bar is fully loaded. From wine, to beers on tap, and spirits galore... if you have a drink in mind they can make it. They have a menu of custom cocktails which are delicious and change seasonally. There are some drinks that are not on the menu that only a select few bartenders know how to make, my favorite being the rooftop.   Let&#39;s talk customer service next... WOW, do they go above and beyond. These bartenders and bar-backs are working on overdrive all the time, yet are efficient, excellent, and to top it all off friendly and welcoming. Even with the largest of crowds they will get to you and serve you with a smile!  Needless to say this is one of my favorite watering-holes in San Jose. I would definitely recommend coming to check it out... their margaritas are top notch as well!!!  
                  Great service and great drinks at reasonable prices! Love the open atmosphere. Great location, friendly staff. Good for families, pets, and large groups.  
                  This place was a suggestion from some new friends and boy was I glad I went. Its right in downtown near a public parking lot. They validate parking (I saw the validation machine at the Market Bar). The place is huge and full of awesome places to eat, have a drink, have some coffee, have a snack... I was told they have live music at night as well! There is plenty of seating and stand up tables down the middle inside, and 2 outdoor seating areas as well.     Im a huge fan and I will definitely be back!  
                  This is the &#34;bar&#34; that sits in the middle of the San Pedro Square Market.  Can be confusing but once there it all unfolds itself.  Quite comfortable bar, nice booze, flat screens, comfy bar stools, what&#39;s not to like?   Solid plusses for this place are that you can bring your drink anywhere in this market.  Indoors or outdoors.  While sipping you can also take advantage of all the offerings from all the stores in this diverse food court.  Falafels, tacos, sausages, ice cream, pizza are all for the taking here.  The drinks are strong here, which I like, so you don&#39;t have to keep refilling them.  The Hang Glider is where it is at for me.  A huge wine goblet is muddled with berry (you get to choose) then topped with flavored vodka (lemon, I believe) and finished with sparkling water/soda.  Supa refreshing outdoors in the summer months.  Their Pimm&#39;s Cup was pretty but not as solid as I&#39;ve had else where.  Love the concept of this market and love that this bar is a focal point.  Great community concept for this town, way to go, San Ho!  
                  What a great atmosphere ! We came here a few hours before the Sharks game, and it was awesome seeing all the Sharks fans before they headed to the game. Lots of different drinks and meals to choose from, pretty seating, just an overall great place to hang out with a group of friends and take your dogs!  
                  I only LOVE this bar because it&#39;s right at the crossroads between the outdoor seating and still inside the square doors with all of the other food shops.  I&#39;ve only been here once for HH, but their prices are great for starting out on a night of fun in dtn SJ. I&#39;ve had an IPA beer both times that I&#39;ve been here (don&#39;t remember exactly what), but they haven&#39;t been hoppy enough for me :( I don&#39;t think they have a big enough beer selection here--it seems to be more about the cocktails and mixed concoctions.  However, I did want to point out that all bartenders have been very pleasant and kind with me every time that I have visited. THAT is very important because we all know how annoying pesky customers can be during peak HH times! So cheers to the bartenders who work here.  With that being said though, the most recent time I got a beer with a friend, we noticed that the glass was cracked. It&#39;s not a big deal, but we just took it back to the bartender and he got me another glass. No biggie, but just look before you serve next time :)   I&#39;ll very likely be back the next time I decide to relax or have fun in downtown.  
                  I&#39;ve been here one time, it was a Sunday afternoon. My friends and I had brunch at Flames and ten we met up with one of my friend&#39;s boyfriends down here. I&#39;ve walked by this place many times, but never stopped in.   Once we get inside the market, we find his boyfriend sitting with other friends of his at an outside table. It was a really nice summer day, they had the Giants game on multiple televisions. We sat down and a couple of the people had ordered food from other places. One of the girl&#39;s sandwiches and fries looked good, even though O was full from brunch.   We decided to keep our Sunday funday going and went to the bar to get more drinks. One of my friends ordered a glass of wine, the other three of us decided to get berry coolers? I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s what they were called. They were so delicious! I&#39;m pretty sure I had two of them. Then we saw the bucket of beer that the table had next to us. They said that it was only $15 for 5 beers. We thought that sounded good, so we got one of those too. Last, but not least, my friend&#39;s boyfriend had a really good fruit drink. It was a little more on the tart side, instead if sweet. I ordered one of those and then I was good to go for the rest of the Sunday funday.   The bartender (whose name I don&#39;t remember) was really nice and was the one to suggest the berry coolers. She served us right away each time and made excellent drinks. I guess it depends on the time and day that you go there. But that Sunday afternoon was the perfect time to go. I&#39;m a fan!  
                  Good place for a drinks and people watching. There is seating outside and inside. You can also get a waitress if you don&#39;t want to go to the bar.  
                  Just reviewing the bar and not the Market itself, since I have a separate review for that, so let&#39;s begin. There is a decent selection of liquors, which are of better quality than most of the bars directly surrounding the market place. As a whiskey man myself, I enjoy the fact that I have more to choose from than the typical Jameson, Jack, and Makers. I usually stick with a glass of scotch or beer, but my girlfriend gets their mixed drinks and they have some pretty tasty ones. Falon&#39;s Revenge, I believe it&#39;s called, is a really good one. Spicy, yet refreshing. The bar can get pretty crowded, but the bartenders do a pretty good job of getting through customers quickly.   There&#39;s nothing amazing about this bar, no special theme or gimmick to draw in a crowd, but it&#39;s not meant to be. It&#39;s part of San Pedro Square Market; it&#39;s part of a community of eateries. It serves it&#39;s purpose as a bar for the community and its good at it.  
                  This place is great to hang out with friends and grab a drink. The only con is that it can get super packed and hard to find a seat. It is a great spot to stop by before or after a Shark&#39;s game.  
                  If you are looking for a casual drinks out, this is a perfect place to go. They give you plastic cups and you can take them out on the patio outside and enjoy the weather. Drinks are good. Why a 3 star? Because the bartender was dumb. The couple in front of me, she first tells them $10 for 2 drinks, then changes her mind to $12. She told me $5 but then rang me up for $6. Made me wonder if she just doesn&#39;t know prices or is lying...  
                  Just a typical weekend out, a great place for that and the scene is pretty fun! When there are live bands is when the fun begins. Great bars, great food and with awesome company you will have a great time.  
                  Very disappointed that they did not have JD Honey and even more disappointed that the bartender didn&#39;t offer anything else in lieu.  But what was I expecting from a chic bartender!  For some odd reason I have no luck with female bartenders, they are always short and get easily irritated when I tell them what I want.  IDK ... Anyways, while she poured my friend&#39;s beer I looked around and they had Fireball whiskey and being so early on a Friday, I decided to go for it.  She was prompt and asked if I wanted to leave the tab open... really?  Does it look like I want to party on?!? lol I guess I did... Friendly gal, just not friendly to me.  There was plenty of people drinking and lounging as usual on a Friday, so I will definitely come back. maybe next time i&#39;ll get a male bartender ;)  
                  Put the wrong review in the wrong place since Yelp was acting up on my phone. I really do love the San Pedro Square Market. Great place to hang out and meet with friends, get some good grub and some great drinks. I will always make a stop here when I am in downtown SJ.  
                  Love this place for all kinds of gatherings...enough said...great for parties...drinking...singing...live bands r there...bar is great..and love the food..parking is nearby with a lot of cabs as well  
                  Great location for a bar... but that just means a ton of people and meh service. Located in San Pedro Square, it&#39;s the perfect place to grab a beer to start your night. However, you&#39;d have to definitely push through the crowd that gathers in front of the bar. When you do get to the front though, you&#39;re met with bartenders who probably care more about handing out as many drinks as they can. For me, I like bars that have bartenders who at least give you a few minutes of their time to give you their recommendations or what not.  Beers are $6, so you won&#39;t break your bank if you drank beer here. They do have wooden tables on the side so it&#39;s a great place to hang out with you friends. Get there early during busy nights though otherwise you won&#39;t have any where to sit!  
                  This place is good as a pit stop. Not too many seating places with all the good food stands. And if you get there on a busy or hot night, good lucky sitting outside in the hot sun on summer days!   Good location to meet friends and then move on. They don&#39;t have too many of the popular brews, not even local, but still pretty tasty beers.  
                  This location is near perfect, benefiting from being at the epicenter of all things SPSM and SPSM being so integral to downtown&#39;s reinvigoration: there&#39;re fewer places more trafficked and better for people-watching than San Pedro Square Market.  That popularity, though, translates into a busy, busy bar - so much so that the wait to get a drink from the bartenders can be mood-stiflingly long. Not for a lack of trying - the bartenders are proficient, but there&#39;s only so much they can do when the crowd is 3 deep and perchers/regulars constantly vie for attention. Your better bet is to scout out and score a table if you can find one and have a waitstaff tend to your beverage needs.  The waitresses* and bussers are some of the most earnest working people here (they service throughout the bar area, communal dining area(s) and the patio) and have always been friendly and pleasant in my experience, I&#39;m more than happy to commune with them and leave some well-deserved tips!  The attention to customer service (particularly from the waitstaff) is one of my favorite facets; they make SPSM feel homey and family-friendly. _____________________ *... also they&#39;re cute, they&#39;re cute. And they&#39;re cute, too. #what  
                  I love this bar.  Great selection and friendly service.  The bartenders (especially Rachael) are always professional and very accommodating.   Do yourself a favor, and stop by for a beer or a glass of wine.  
                  The beer market inside has a good selection, especially if you like pale ales. It can be hard to find a seat outdoors, but it is nice in the summertime if you can find a spot. They usually have the games on inside or cooking shows. Plenty of selections for food around there as well. The beer is the best deal in the place and good for being social with a group of friends.  
                  SP Market Bar is pricey, and always busy. Drinks range from strong to weak depending on your bartender. The beer selection on tap is usually pretty decent, I can always find something I like, and overall their selection of liquor is pretty awesome.  It&#39;s a great concept in a great location, so there will undoubtedly be many more nights spent here.  
                  The bartender there was great about making me a drink to my liking.  She was super chill and open to hearing what I wanted.  Other people at the bar were super friendly, too.  The best part is that you can take your drink outside!  
                  I like this bar because it has lots of IPA on tap and sports playing across 3 tvs. The prices are fair too. For example, a Johnnie Walker black on the rocks and draft IPA comes out to $15. Lots of indoor and outdoor seating is available too, but it does fill up though.  
                  Early Saturday evening... walked up, was greeted very politely by 2 bartenders and got our 2 beers right away.  Yummy beer.  That was it.  
                  Service is a little on the slow side but he didn&#39;t seem to mind.  Actually I didn&#39;t mind either because we were there to enjoy the evening - to spend time w/ each other even though I was pretty peeved because his Pandora was on almost the entire time.    I like the fact that you can order practically anywhere inside San Pedro Square Market.  You don&#39;t even have to get up because servers prance around to ask if you would like a drink and if you leave the tab open, they&#39;ll continue to ask until you close your tab.    If you&#39;re enjoying a Neapolitan pizza from Pizza Bocca Lupo, poutine fries from Little Chef Counter, or crab cake sliders from Sama-Zama either inside the gourmet food court (San Pedro Square Market) or on their outside patio, you can satisfy your alcoholic needs here.  
                  I recently went here for the first time and loved it. I liked the variety of food choices and plenty of seating. I knew it would be busy on certain nights so I choose a Sunday to make my first visit.  There was plenty of seating and great in door and out door options.  I was shocked at how high the drinks are here.  I&#39;m a mixed drink person so, it can be expensive.  I went back for trivia night on Monday and I had a blast.  I&#39;m very happy to see  San Jose is growing in a positive direction.  
                  If you&#39;re looking for a great place to grab a beer or adult beverage on a nice day, if recommend San Pedro Sq Market Bar.   Yesterday was such a nice day, and it was made all the better with a cold pilsner and a shady spot on the patio outside. Great outdoor space with plenty of seating. The after work crowd is friendly and not too busy, we we&#39;re served quickly.   Not sure if they have happy hour, but a draught beer ran me $5, not too bad. I&#39;ll definitely be back, especially with more warm evenings on the horizon :)  
                  This bar gets busy, but they in addition to ordering at the bar, they do have table service.Very impressed by that! Our server was friendly, fast and and really nice. The service was better than at a lot of bars, (some higher end) that I&#39;ve been to.  Drinks are pretty good, and very reasonably priced. If I was at the the market again, I&#39;d definitely come back here:)  
                  Okay, I gave them another shot.  I think that the bartender who was previously here who was causing all the issues is gone.  They now have bartenders who are attentive and make good drinks.    Thanks to the guy last night who made my friend her first pisco sour.  I&#39;m not entirely sure how to read that smirk he had-- amusement?  irritation?  agreement with our good taste? So ambiguous.  I know it&#39;s labor intensive-- he even had to run across the bar to get an egg!  I really appreciated all the hard work.  He made a darn good pisco sour, too.  This place has matured nicely over the past year.  The scene is full of all kinds of people, from downtown bankers to guys with beers to hip 20 somethings.  The patio area is so nice (though I could do without the random TVs outdoors, they sort of ruin the vibe to me.)  The other part of the market is finally starting to fill up with businesses too (cheese shop, treatbot), so this is really starting to become a destination!  
                  Solid beers on tap (Stone IPA, Racer 5 IPA, and Anderson Valley Brewing Co&#39;s Boont Amber make it into regular rotation) at around $6/glass. If there&#39;s no room at the bar, you can take your beverage and wander around the whole of San Pedro Square - it doesn&#39;t seem that there are alcohol restrictions in any area.  Bonus - parking validation for the lot across the street!  
                  Yummmmmmmmm. Had my first Bloody Mary!   AMAZING. I will definitely be back for another some time!  
                  Things have gotten much better, the bartenders are faster and more attentive and the increase of other bars in the area (market beer, garage bar, sp2 next door) seems to have alleviated some of the rush.  
                  So, you&#39;re super thirsty and all you have is a bottle of water.  You&#39;re dying of thirst and you&#39;re in San Pedro Square.  Oh where, oh where are you going to find a place to drink and end your dry spell?  Why, San Pedro Square Market Bar of course!  With beers on tap and a modest amount of liquor, San Pedro Square Market Bar is one of those bars you and a few buds can go to and have a good time.  A few buddies and I went to San Pedro Square to celebrate Sunday-Funday.  What&#39;s Sunday-Funday?  That&#39;s when a couple of guys go out and have fun without the SOs nagging us to death about why we didn&#39;t tape the last episode of Love and Hip Hop.    We decided we wanted to wet our whistles and saw SPSMB.  We laid our firm buttocks on the stools and focused at the numerous liqours at hand.  We were greeted by the waitress, who was very friendly and attentive.  We ordered our drinks with no problems, and we downed our drinks with no problems.    Two drinks in, we were already buzzed.  As we sat comatose, she looked at us and said ,&#34;Sunday-Funday?  Are you guys done?  Geez....&#34;  Hey!  We&#39;ve been drinking the past 2 days.  Plus, we&#39;re old.  Sure we have those Asian genes which makes us look like we&#39;re 21, but that doesn&#39;t mean our insides are still lively and young.  It was great that she was cracking jokes with us.  I don&#39;t know how much the drinks were because I didn&#39;t get a chance to pay for them.  However, I did hear my friend say the drinks weren&#39;t expensive, considering there was 5 of us and all we ordered was beers.    We&#39;d all come here again.  We were able to get our drinks in a timely manner, the service was great, and the place is next to La Vic&#39;s!  Ohhh yeah baby!  Me likey!  
                  Heavy pours, good specials.  Wait can be long if San Pedro Square chooses to be crowded.  Depends on the night.  Lots of open area for seating and nearby finger foods to satisfy bar munchies.  Outdoor patio seating available on nice days.  
                  What a great place to have a bar! Its the first thing I saw after walking across the courtyard. I came here to enjoy some food and  a beer while watching the 49ers pre-season game against the Denver Broncos. By the looks of the crowd this is the spot to hang out and socialize after putting 8-10 hours for &#34;THE MAN.&#34; In addition to this bar there is a wonderful food court type setting offering scrumptious eats. I can&#39;t wait to come back here the next time I visit home!  
                  Fun vibe.  This place is like a series of food trucks, only you get to sit down and drink beers.  The service is super friendly, and the beer selection is ample.  Great place to hang out, watch games, and enjoy the delicious food.  
                  Love how this place is spacious and has a lot of seating (both inside and outside), but HATE how small the bar really is. It takes a good while to order a drinks with the millions of customers and 2 bartenders working.  Drinks prices are fair and what makes it even better is how strong they are!! I ordered the usual Jameson with Gingerale, and it was as if I was drinking it on the rocks.  Crowd is diverse here. SUPER packed when theres a game going on.  Would come here again!  
                  Had the best mojito of my life here. The bartenders are all kinda bitchy and unhappy seeming though, hence the lower star count. I have also had a great strawberry ale from here. Great alcohol, only okay service. Still worth a try for the San Pedro Market-goer who wants a quick drink.  
                  I like SPSMB! This is such a spacy bar! I love how they have a lot big screens that are mounted to the wall so we all can have a good view of the game! Though it&#39;s kinda hard to hear the game even when it&#39;s not even crowded.  This bar kinda reminds me a of food court since they have a few selection of small restaurants inside the bar. I&#39;ve tried the pizza and it is DELICIOUS! Can&#39;t wait to try other food they have to offer as well!  I love the &#39;backyard&#39; of SPSMB, it&#39;s huge! It a really chill spot to sit, drink and eat and get to know someone kinda place. They have two restrooms which is great because other bars have really long lines!   Overall, I would recommend at least checking this place out!  On a not-so-good note: It&#39;s kinda odd to have such a big bar with a small crowd. It makes this place seems dead all the time. I wish it was crackin&#39;! Turn into some kind of night club at night! Make this big spacy bar useful- since San Pedro Square mostly have sports bar only; it&#39;d be nice not to have to walk to 2nd street to get my dancin&#39; on. haha!  
                  My first experience here was great, the bartenders were super friendly and helpful. The drinks are good and a really good price.  My go-to drink is a moscow mule, not all places serve it since not all bars carry ginger beer. Not only did was the bartender able to make me a really good moscow mule, but he was also able to customize it with added jalapeno just like I asked without any hesitation.  I would definitely come back to the bar more often!  
                  Lots of places to hang out with friends and have a drink.  
                  Of all the different choices in the vicinity, I think SPSMB is a neat addition, especially to SPSM. My reasoning?   Sometimes you want to watch some sports and not be committed. My example is the NBA Playoffs... I came watched the ending to some games that meant nothing to me but was curious and had a beer. When it was done, went home.  Not everybody might understand my reasoning but for those of you do - this is a good half hour time killer with no commitment and is as easy breezy as you can get.  Good: - Draft selection is decent - Nice, large TVs - Food nearby - Feeling of not being in a &#34;bar&#34;, while being in a bar  Bad: - Once it gets crowded, it&#39;s a hot mess. This only happened once to me during shark playoffs. I stood and watched the game on the patio. Acceptable  
                  Been here a couple times.  Very pleasant place to enjoy a glass of wine or a Napoleon style pizza.  Our busser was perhaps the best part!  He brought my dog a bowl of water :)  
                  The Market Bar is the beating heart of San Pedro Square Market.  It&#39;s so popular (because it&#39;s not just a food stall like the rest of the place) that it&#39;s hard to squeeze in a get a beer at the bar.  It can be also hard to find an indoor table BUT IF YOU DO, it&#39;s a great spot to spend a relaxed time on a date or with friends going back to the bar for drinks, watching football on the screens, and hopping over to the food stalls to get snacks when you run out. It&#39;s great for people watching too because there&#39;s plenty of traffic flowing through to the other areas of SP Square.  
                  The bar itself is nestled inside a warehouse-like enclave. In all reality, it is pretty much an upscale food court with a bar inside. I like the laid back vibe here providing a good mix of people. The outdoor seating is the perfect place for a drink in the summertime. The bar can get busy, but the bartenders here do their best to push the drinks out. My bartender is Brian; I go to him every time whether I buy shots, mixed drinks, or his specialties. Regardless, all the bartenders there are friendly and make great drinks. The selection of beers on tap are pretty standard with the regular stuff and then some seasonal beers.  Shoot, I think I&#39;m getting old. I find myself coming here a lot now when I have no solid plans to go out. Not to say it&#39;s a bad thing coming here but my weekends are less about clubbing, less about getting f&#39;d up at some random house, and more of going to places like these to drink and people watch.  
                  The bartenders are really friendly.  They have beer on tap.  It&#39;s the surrounding pretentious clientele that can go suck a d*ck.  
                  Rating is based on the tap beer selection and the TV&#39;s found all across their bar area.  I had the Stone IPA and the Scrimshaw over the course of a few hours but during the cheap happy hour, there weren&#39;t too many people there but once the hour hits 6pm, the bar area of the Market filled up quick, considering that they were the only full service bar that could do mixed drinks as well.  I sat at one of those high chair wooden beam tables that was a little &#34;rickety&#34; so caution to those who sit here.  Make sure to avoid bumping your table too much or else drinks will be spilled all over the place.  I was lucky enough to get my beers before the crowds and the end of happy hour.  A previous reviewer posted $4 beers but the first round of two beers I got were $10 total for a Stone IPA and an Alligash White.  Ehhh $5 is just as good as $4.    Bartenders were cool to accommodate my request to have the channel switched to Thursday night TNT basketball too.  
                  Had soooo much fun watching the USA World Cup game today at the market &amp; market bar with all my friends! I was especially impressed with the bar staff; they did a great job of managing the huge crowd and it didn&#39;t seem like anyone was waiting very long for their orders. We stayed a bit after the game to get some food and wait out the traffic and I noticed the wait staff also did a great job of cleaning up all the leftover bottles and glassware from the departing crowd so the atmosphere was still nice and clean for those of us who chose to linger. Also, the Konjoe Burgers were FANTASTIC and my friend really liked Robee&#39;s Falafels as well! All in all this was a great afternoon-- way more fun than a small backyard BBQ especially for big events like the World Cup! I&#39;ll be back soon for sure.  
                  After attending a local festival on 6/3/12, my friend and I weren&#39;t ready to go home. So we headed to San Pedro Square to find something to do. After checking out a couple vendors in San Pedro Square Market, we decided to grab a drink at a nearby bar. Then we returned to SPSM and decided to check out the Market Bar. We both really loved the ambiance of the open indoor and outdoor seating to the public.  They had about eight beers on tap and a full bar. The beer menu wasn&#39;t readily available so I had to ask another patron for theirs when they finished using it. I have to admit the bartenders were slow in acknowledging us but there were a couple other guests ordering, so no big deal.  The most appealing thing was they have HAPPY HOUR ALL DAY SUNDAY. I only got a quick glance, but the craft beers were about $6 or $7 a pint. With the HH special, we paid $5 for each beer. I know they had other specials. I wish I would have taken a picture of the menu. We definitely want to return on a Sunday afternoon to chill with friends.  
                  Came here for my birthday, and finally got to try this place.  I had been to San Pedro Square numerous times, but only usually came here for a parking validation if anything.  Tried one of their specials, the something-penicillin.  Really good gin-based drink, definitely not watered down.  They seem to have some pretty good cocktails here, no idea of the cost since a friend bought it for me, but very good overall!  The atmosphere of this place is great!  Although it is very busy on weekends, so expect to potentially sit outside in the cold.  But there are heater lamps as well so it works out.  
                  Great place to walk around. I love the atmosphere.  One thing that I wish there was more of would be local beer. Especially in a place that has the this sort of vibe. I would hope that they would separate themselves from other local options by having more craft beers.  
                  Casual place for all age groups. Great outdoor place with good live music .. Finger food with lots of choice for beer lovers. This is not for cocktail lovers. beer lovers can get enough beer here as there is too much choice!
