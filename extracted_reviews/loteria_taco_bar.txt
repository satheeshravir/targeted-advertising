                  I love fancy tacos. And judging by the prices of this place, &#34;fancy&#34; is what I was expecting. The menu includes a myriad of unique and exotic flavor combinations; I got the 3 tacos for $12 combo, which came with chips and salsa on the side. My two friends and I also got a plate of the plantains to share, which we couldn&#39;t finish because we were all SUPER full by the end, more so than any of us were expecting.  A good lunch spot if you&#39;re in the area and craving some none-traditional fusion tacos, but still a little pricey for what you&#39;re getting in my opinion.  
                  Having been to San Pedro Square a few times, I decided to try this taco bar before heading to the Sharks game at SAP Center. The menu had a bunch of different items and had a unique spin on the classic tacos.  I got three tacos for $12. I got a fried cod, duck carnitas, and pork belly taco.   Fried Cod : This taco was by far the best out of the ones that I got and on the menu, it stated that this was their most popular. After going to university for 4 years in San Diego, I&#39;ve had my fair share of fish tacos. This one tasted very good and comparable to the ones that I&#39;ve had. The cod was crispy and the sauce they put on top complimented it well. I also enjoyed the cilantro and lettuce/carrot slaw they put on it.  Pork Belly : This taco was average. It was very hard to actually taste the pork belly because the pineapple salsa and red jalapeños were pretty overpowering.   Duck Carnitas: Unlike the pork belly taco, the only thing I could taste on this taco were the duck carnitas. It was very filling however it lacked a depth of flavor.  All of the tacos were fully filled and the plate came with a little container of salsa and tortilla chips. Out of the three tacos that I got, I would probably only get the fried cod taco again.  
                  Pros: situated in a trendy spot. Offers some unconventional meats tk choose from- korean bbq short ribs and duck for example   Cons: some what of a long line. Pricing quite high. Tacos tasted average.... No side condiments available. :\   To be quite frank, this is a hip restaurant with mediocre tasting food.  
                  Came by for lunch the other day and it was a mediocre experience. The line prior to the lunch rush was minimal.  Cod soft taco was the highlight of the meal as it came out warm and the sauce had a nice kick to it.  The carne asada taco came out dry and wasn&#39;t too flavorful...  The chips were decent although the salsa came from the fridge and tasted like it had been there for a little too long...  Service was okay.  ~$8.5+ tax for 2 tacos including chips and salsa.  They do take credit cards.  
                  The best catering. Fancy &amp; flavor tacos !!!        The Fish &amp; Shrimp fajitas, lamb, chicken, and the mango salsa were fantastic at my party! Everyone enjoyed the fantastic food.  
                  I&#39;m a huge fan of San Pedro Market, and Loteria Taco bar is one of my (new) favorites. I just love the tacos here, and I have been a frequent visitor. I would say that something is clearly good when there are so many options but you keep coming back to the tacos. They&#39;re just like authentic street tacos, but with a little fusion. I also think it&#39;s a relatively good deal for tacos and beans. My most recent trip, I tried the fried pickles, and I did not think that they were that great. I loved the dipping sauce that was served with them, but felt there was much too much breading on the pickle itself. I was anticipating large pickle slices from the size, and it turned out they were little slices, just a ton of breading.   Overall, I&#39;ll skip the fried pickles and come back for the tacos!  
                  Wait time was okay- 10 minutes. Prices are typical for San Jose downtown -12$ for a lunch size portion. expect to spend more if you order drinks and extras. I had the fried plantains which were AMAZING. I shared them with coworkers and everyone kept asking where they came from. I got two tacos, one salmon one quinoa, both were fresh and tasted great. I&#39;ll definitely return to try the many other taco varieties they had to offer. ( I believe they had about 10 different kinds to choose from)  
                  Don&#39;t expect authentic Mexican tacos. These fancy tacos are a bit pricey. The bright red chips look like Doritos nacho cheese flavored but they were just regular chips. We ordered chicken, chipotle shrimp and fried cod. Since it was a Lent Friday, I only had the shrimp and cod. The fried cod is far superior. The flavor of the aioli was good. The texture was alright but it wasn&#39;t as crispy as Rubio&#39;s fish tacos.  
                  Best tacos ever made by Nary. Ask for something special so he can make you a masterpiece taco.  
                  They had such a good pastor taco topped with pineapple salsa! Soooooo good. Will definitely be coming back for more of those.   The salsa for the chips could&#39;ve been a little more tasteful. Ok, just blander than I&#39;d prefer.  
                  Cod Fish taco: 4 stars Carne Asada taco: 3.5 stars Shrimp taco: 3 stars   This place is kinda pricey for tacos, however, it is located in San Pedro Square so can&#39;t complain. It&#39;s a much better deal to get more tacos, 3 for $11 as one taco is $4. The tacos come with chips and salsa. Add some guacamole on the side and you&#39;ll have a super filling lunch!   The cod fish tacos are their most popular and I can see why. They are delicious. Good hefty piece of fish, not too much batter and really good sauce on it. Fresh veggies (purple cabbage, tomatoes).   The Carne Asada taco was tasty. They actually add guacamole too it too which is awesome. It does make it a little hard to eat though and can get quite messy.  Shrimp taco was just medocre to me. Nothing too special about the shrimp. They were a bit on the smaller side and not very plentiful so it felt like I was eating a tortilla taco filled with sauce and purple cabbage haha. Sauce was good. My boyfriend did like this one the best though.   Their Guacamole is really good too. Not to over seasoned like the ones at Chipotle.   I&#39;d definitely come back here again and just get 3 cod fish tacos.. YUM!  
                  3.5 stars!   Loteria taco bar is located inside San Pedro Square Market and it&#39;s all about TACOS. they offer a ton of taco options - pork, beef, seafood, vegetarian, chicken, and even duck! In addition to tacos, they also offer fried plantains, garlic yucca fries, quesadillas, and churros! The giant menu in the front of their space is very enticing.   I was really craving fish tacos and they have two on their regular menu and they also had two on their specials menu: spicy tilapia and mahi mahi. I ordered the two fish tacos on the specials menu and the fried cod taco (the menu says it&#39;s their most popular taco). I also ordered the garlic yucca fries. I think my tacos took about 6-7 minutes and there had been maybe two parties ahead of me. My yucca fries took a little longer cuz they fried it when I ordered it. They call out your name when the order is ready so you have to stick around the taco bar. Thank goodness it&#39;s right next to the bar.   The fish tacos were good. The ingredients were fresh. The spicy tilapia definitely had a spicy kick to it. But I kind of felt like some of the ingredients and flavors overpowered the fish, which should&#39;ve been the stars. My plate of tres tacos came with tortilla chips and salsa. I rounded up cuz I thought the yucca fries were pretty tasty. Yummy garlicky flavor and the two sauces that it came with went well with the fries. The yucca wasn&#39;t dried out at all - and it was fried perfectly. My friend ordered the housemade churros that came with a chocolate sauce. They fry these up when you order them and they tasted pretty good too! I love to eat tacos so I&#39;ll come back to try out the beef and pork tacos. And maybe their quesadillas too.  
                  The tacos were delicious and they make them quickly. It is also awesome that they let you mix and match, since there are so many different specialty tacos on the menu. The fried rock cod one with chipotle aioli and cabbage was the best fish taco that I have had in a while!  
                  This is not my first choice of food at San Pedro Market (I usually eat at CaliDog and the pizza place), but sometimes I like to change it up a bit.    I&#39;m a vegetarian so I haven&#39;t tried a variety of the tacos which most people seem to order but I did have the vegetarian taco once, I believe it was quinoa and black bean but the taco was very bland and left much to be desired. I didn&#39;t even finish it  which is saying a lot because I almost always finish my food. I had the yucca fries that same visit though and they were delicious. I would definitely suggest ordering those.   The last time I went I got the Market Vegetable quesadilla which was very tasty. It had peppers and mushrooms in it. I really liked how it came with sour cream, salsa, and guacamole on the side. The quesadilla cost $9 which seems pricey but it was a large portion.  
                  I love the tacos here. One of my go to spots at SPS.  Love that you can &#34;mix and match,&#34; and I&#39;ve never had a bad pick. I&#39;ve had duck, pork belly, portabello (vegetarian), chicken, and carnitas. All have been good, all with complimentary toppings and salsa.  
                  Came here on my lunch break and ordered myself some spicy tilapia tacos for lunch. I found the tacos to be okay, but they were lacking something special. The tilapia was not even that spicy and didn&#39;t have much of a flavor to it. I may have made the wrong choice by ordering fish, but as it stands I don&#39;t think the tacos were worth the price.  
                  Beware, the salsa verde packs a huge punch! I&#39;m a spicy food lover and this got my eyes watering. If you have a sensitive palette (or stomach) request no verde. Really good otherwise.  
                  Ahi tuna taco was dry and pretty meh. Veggie quinoa taco was sloppy and pretty good. (Definitely thought it would&#39;ve been the other way around with the taco sitch.) The horchata was served from an open plastic barrel with a ladle and like pretty much every horchata ever: Flawless.   Located at a counter-service stand within San Pedro Square, the menu is mucho enticing and the foodies come out hella quick, but the end product doesn&#39;t leave me wanting more. The girl at the counter was super friendly, especially for a person who&#39;s probably cooped up in that tiny kiosk space all day.   I was a fan of their spicy salsa, which goes much bolder on the heat than any other casual, sorta-meant-for-the-masses resto I&#39;ve ever been to. I liked that my taco meal came with tortilla chips, even if they were a tad on the stale side.   It seemed like there was no shortage of options as far as tacos and this area are concerned, so I&#39;d likely shop around before heading back - though, to be fair, I only sampled a very small portion of their non-mammal meat menu so maybe their beef, chicken, pork, and other tacos are where it&#39;s at.  
                  I came here for lunch twice - the first time I got the carne aside taco and shrimp chipotle taco. Two tacos were about $8 w/ tax, which in my opinion isn&#39;t too pricey for the quality of the tacos and amount of carne asada and shrimp I got.  Carne asada taco - 2/5 stars. The flavor wasn&#39;t there for me. The meat didn&#39;t have a &#39;grilled&#39; taste and was a little bland all around. I won&#39;t re-order this one  Shrimp chipotle - 5/5 stars. The shrimp wasn&#39;t overcooked! I wasn&#39;t expecting too much since I came during lunch rush, but the shrimp was nicely cooked, and the sauce it came with was amazing. It had a little kick but not too spicy. The cabbage it came with was also nice and crunchy. The tortilla was also good - not dry or hard. The second time I came back I just ordered two shrimp chipotle tacos!  The service was friendly and I got my food pretty quickly, especially for being during lunch rush. I&#39;ll definitely be back. I want to try the fried cod taco that seems like the &#39;thing&#39; to order.  
                  3.5 stars!   With so many options in the San Pedro Market, it really was difficult to choose something for lunch, but the tacos were calling to me.  I got the chicken with mango salsa, the tuna ahi, and the fried cod tacos.  The chicken tacos were pretty good and the mango salsa really brings all the flavors together.  I also enjoyed the fish taco... nice and spicy.  The tuna taco was good; it&#39;s just that the the sweet soy glaze was kind of on the salty side and that detracted from the other flavors of the taco.   Overall, there is a lot of variety and Loteria will satisfy a taco craving!  
                  Only ordered the duck carnitas taco with spicy mole, it was probably the best taco I have ever had! My friend ordered the el pastor and said the same about here&#39;s.  You must try this taco spot the next time your at San Pedro square.  
                  I had been here last summer. That was the first time I had ever tasted shrimp taco and they just blew my mind. They were dee-licious. Unfortunately they weren&#39;t quite as good tonight. The shrimps were very bland. I hope they improve them!  
                  One of my go to places in San Pedro Market. Love the Portabello Tacos, there are always amazing. I like that they have expanded their menu lately and have tried the mahi mahi taco recently which was very good.   The fried cod is one of their most popular per their sign but I wasnt all that impressed when I tried it. Their chips and salsa is good and there is just the right level of heat.   Skip the rice and beans though and get another taco! They have little flavor and are really just filler.  
                  The chef is there right now is super awesomeness and awesome cook!! I mean the that looks like a porcupine !!  
                  Best taco joint in San Jose! Everything on their menu is delicious and will not disappoint. Great staff, great experience.  
                  I love this taco place. They always give you a lot of meat on your tacos and it always tastes fresh! Definitely one of my go to places whenever I go to San Pedro Square Market.  
                  I&#39;ve eaten here a few times, and while the food has been good, it hasn&#39;t been great. Especially considering the price of the tacos. Unfortunately for this restaurant, you can get amazing tacos all over the bay area that are $1-$2 a pop.  That being said, it&#39;s not bad...and they have an interesting array of taco selections, which I do like. So, take your chances.  
                  I used to love this place. It had a fantastic mango habanero chicken taco that was out of this world. They changed their menu and got rid of my favorite taco!! So I settled for the carne asada taco and this has even changed. No guac on the taco and the steak was on the dry side.  They also changed their rice. It is now Mexican rice and its just okay. This was one of my favorites in San Pedro Marketplace, but now, eh...  The service was great and fast. Very friendly when explaining that the menu had changed. It was just that everything I was wanting from here is gone or different.  I am not totally giving up, but I don&#39;t think I will be back nearly as often. They had something good going on, I just don&#39;t know why they had to change things.  
                  My boyfriend and I were in the mood for Cuban food tonight so we were planning to go to the restaurant down the street from San Pedro Square Market, only to find out they were closed today for some reason. All we could think about were those fried plantains... So, disappointed, we walked back to San Pedro Square, hoping to find something that could satiate us. The first place we came upon that neither of us had tried was the taco bar. Upon first glancing at the menu, two things stood out to me: fried plantains and duck tacos. FRIED PLANTAINS!! So I&#39;ll start off with those. They were amazing, and my boyfriend and I liked them so much we had to fight over the last few. The &#39;spicy&#39; cream or whatever came with them was a little tasteless...it honestly reminded me of sour cream for some reason.  I asked about the size of the tacos, and since they&#39;re only street-sized, I got two. Obviously, I ordered the duck, which was delicious, and my boyfriend agreed (we have this new obsession with duck).  I also noticed the mahi mahi taco, which is currently a special, so I ordered that as my second taco, while my boyfriend made his second a beef barbacoa.  I accidentally started eating his because I couldn&#39;t tell which was which, but once I discovered I was not eating the duck or the fish, I was relieved. Personally, I did not like the barbacoa. Maybe it was because I was expecting something else? I feel like one of the employees should have told me which plate was which...but whatever. The thing was, once we switched our tacos and I started eating the fish taco, I still felt unsatisfied because the huge chunks of fish turned out to be very dry, with way too much cilantro.  The plantains were what upped this place, and were what will definitely make us come back to try other things. I know I will never order the barbacoa or the fish again, but definitely the duck, and I would love to see what else they have on the menu.  
                  Best tacos in San José!  The owner and staff are great.  They have specials everyday and the tacos are not what you find on the streets or a truck.  They have everything from fried cod/salmon tacos to mushroom tacos.  The friend Yucca with garlic is delicious too..  Give this place a try next time you are at San Pedro square.  
                  Excellent tacos. Good to get away from the restaurants around the convention center. Put lime on the chips for good flavor. Guac. is yum.  
                  Over all great tacos for the taste as well as the price. the food was seasoned and yummy. I had the duck tacos that was AMAZING and would recommend. I would eat here again.  
                  So much MEH. I feel like I have my taco standards set a little high (Dia de Pesca for fish &amp; Taqueria Cancun for Carnitas) but the tacos at Loteria are pretty subpar.   I will vouch for their fried pickles though, those are worth ordering.   2 stars for the tacos, 4 stars for the fried pickles, because if you don&#39;t like fried pickles we can&#39;t be friends.  
                  Yummy !!! Had the portabella raja taco... With squash, cilantro, bell peppers, and some other great veggies (best veggie taco ), and we also had a barbacoa taco which was delicious...Lucky sure did like it... and the chips and guac were perfect finish!  
                  I love coming to San Pedro Square Market and getting one of the taco plates from Loteria Taco bar. My favorite tacos are the fried cod tacos and the tilapia tacos. My girlfriend&#39;s favorites are the pork belly tacos and the carnitas tacos. We&#39;ve frequented this place for at least a year now and are never disappointed in the way our food was cooked and the flavoring is always perfect. The garlic yucca fries are to die for and the plantains are absolutely my favorite side to order....we just wish it were possible to order a half order of each, instead of a whole plate of each!!  Although we&#39;ve never been disappointed, this evening the chips were pretty stale, and my salmon taco (today&#39;s special) was really really over cooked and dry. Such a shame. I ordered the rice and beans as a side, because I&#39;d never actually tried them. The rice is a delicious lime rice, that was cooked perfectly, though the beans were a little bland.   I am giving Loteria a perfect 5 stars, despite today&#39;s experience, because of their perfect track record thus far... I&#39;m sure our future dining experience won&#39;t include stale chips and over cooked salmon again; I might need to edit my review otherwise.  
                  10% off yelp deal is pretty nice, though I didn&#39;t even know it was there.  I like this place!  Their tacos are very well seasoned.  I had the Ahi and the Carne Asada tacos.  Additionally, they are stacked pretty high, so if you&#39;re imaginative/not lazy, you could technically split each taco into two.  They&#39;re also fairly inexpensive (2 tacos for about 7.00 if I recall), although their drinks are fairly pricey for whatever reason ($2 for water?  $3 for coke?  whaaat).  Do note that the Ahi taco is SUPER DRIPPY.  Also it has seaweed on it, which may not be everyone&#39;s cup of tea.  Their tortillas and chips are also very, very plain.  I don&#39;t know whether it was thickness, or freshness, but it was definitely nothing to write home about, which I found slightly depressing, considering the unique fillings they offer.  Still, it&#39;s worth worth checking out.  
                  ¡Este restaurante es simplemente fantastico! This place is awesome! Great people, better food!  
                  Tacos here are pretty upscale compared to the little Mexican shacks that I&#39;m used to.  I&#39;m always reluctant to order from this place, because of the price versus portion ratio but I&#39;m glad I eventually did. I ordered one carnitas and one mango habanero chicken taco. It took a while to come out, but it was so amazing! The carnitas was packed with flavor. The chicken was oh so tender and mango bits made it a refreshing taco!   I&#39;ll definitely come back to try other types of meat they have on the menu. I still think it&#39;s overpriced for a taco.  
                  Foods alright and food comes out decently quick.  Was craving for some fish tacos so this place seemed like it would do the trick.. however it was mediocre in my opinion. Rather go to Rubio for fish tacos, which are way cheaper.   It&#39;s pretty pricy, one taco is about $4 and you save a couple dollars the more you get. The cashier chick was nice, but pretty pushy on asking you if you wanna add more tacos because it&#39;s a better deal.  Ordered 6 tacos in total - 2 seared ahi tuna, 2 al pastor, and 2 duck tacos for me and my cousin and an order of their Yukon fries which are topped with the works (parmasan and garlic).   The tacos are okay, would probably just come back for the seared ahi tuna and the duck.. the al pastor was alrigh, rather go somewhere else and get it for cheaper and better tasting. The fries are disgusting.. while they may look delicious, they actually taste like eating fried dough.. wasted $6 on that.   I guess this is something one should try if the lines for the other places are long..but not something I&#39;d go out of my way for.  
                  Good food nice people and great tasty food and drinks I highly recommend this place if you want good food  
                  Whenever I order here, I only get the tacos, and I usually order the rock cod taco, which is paired with a cole slaw and a type of flavored mayo sauce. The flavors work really well together with the smooth sauce and the soft cod with crunch outer skin. They have deals if you order tacos in 2, 3, or 4. I&#39;ve tried the ahi tuna with a sweet soy sauce and seaweed, and I appreciate the Asian/Mexican fusion, but I still like the rock cod classic w/ a twist better. I&#39;ve heard the duck taco was pretty good as well. The shrimp taco is also pretty good; it has a good deal of spiciness to it, which I really enjoyed.   Each day their specials change(2 items), so sometimes they make tacos off-menu. I really enjoyed the calamari taco, which I have to say is my favorite. They know how to do calamari well, but sometimes not consistently. The first time I&#39;ve had it, it was amazing! The calamari came straight out of the frier, piping hot. The second time they were busier- more rushed, and it certainly showed in the lukewarm temperature of the calamari. The calamari taco also contains a type of avocado chili puree, which i thought complemented the calamari very well due to the slight kick.   Also if you Check-In on Yelp, 10% off your total purchase!  
                  Not very impressed with their taste, not that the quality was not good, is simply did not find it to be tasty enough to want to repeat. A colleague was driving me to the airport and we wanted to stop to eat somewhere and as we are not yet very familiar with what SJ downtown has to offer we checked the San Pedro Square brick and mortar building, that seemed so attractive. My friend went to pick up falafel type of food at another booth and I choose the tacos al pastor from Loteria Taco Bar. Based on the amount of people waiting for their tacos, this is a very popular place. I didn not like that my tacos contain mango (or was it pineapple?) I just don&#39;t see the match and the guy at the counter told me is the way they do them. I will go again to try the churros, as I read from some other Yelper that are really good. So another chance.  
                  My wife is Chapina (de Guatemala) and saw someone at SPS with a plate of beautiful plantain and so we had to hunt down where they had came from.  We found Loteria and ordered the plantain and some tacos to share.   We have been back a few times now &amp; we tend to order the &#34;Super Nachos&#34; (unauthentic, but REALLY good) and the plantains. I agree with my wife by ordering the plantains without cranberries, but  instead asking for an extra container of crema for dipping. Between this and a couple of beers from next door, we are pretty happy. She has decided the plantains are the best in town, if not in the region. They taste a lot like what we enjoy in Antigua, Guat.   A wonderful place and five stars for the smile it puts on her face when we visit.  
                  3.5 stars.  Yesterday marked my first-ever visit to the public market at San Pedro Square.  I arrived just as the throngs of hungry San Jose Sharks fans (myself included) began to settle into the downtown area prior to the Saturday matinee time Sharks game.  After surveying most of the eat spots at the market I decided to give Loteria Taco Bar a try.  Here is their menu from which I ordered from on this date ( yelp.com/biz_photos/lote… ).  I decided to go with the 3 tacos for $10 since the next option of 10 tacos would have been a bit much even for my appetite.  The three tacos I decided to try were the Pork Carnitas, the Mango Habanero Chicken and the Fried Cod.  The Agua Fresca for the day was fresh pineapple (not pictured) and I ordered one of those to wash everything down with.  The Agua Fresca was huge.  The young lady that took my order filled the cup to the very top too.  Darn me for not taking a photo of it!  Friendly staff.  They&#39;ll take your name as the food is prepared to order, and everything seemed to come out in the same sequence as it was ordered.  There were a few people who ordered ahead of me so when the person in front of me got her food I knew I was next.  The overall wait was fairly short, and here&#39;s a look at the beautifully prepared plate of food I got ( yelp.com/biz_photos/lote… ).  Judging from the menu descriptions I wanted to try each taco based on its heat level from the least spicy to the most.  For the most part my assumption was spot on.  Fried Cod - This featured two crispy fried pieces of seasoned cod.  On its own the fish was delicious and perfectly fried.  Combined with the other components however the overall tastiness of the fish was hidden behind the sharp taste of the chipotle crema and the pickled slaw.  Pork Carnitas - Loteria Taco Bar is super generous with their taco fillings as there were two big pieces of carnitas in this taco.  The overall flavor was very good, and I thought the pork worked well with the tomatillo chile, chopped red onion and cilantro.  This was possibly my favorite of the three tacos I ate.  Mango Habanero Chicken - I like mango, and I imagined the flavor of this taco would be intense.  It was, in fact, quite tasty especially in the sense of how the sweetness of the mango contrasted with the pickled onion and the habanero peppers.  I was right in that this selection packed the most heat, but the mountain of shredded white meat chicken was definitely on the dry side.  Beyond the habaneros I thought the chicken itself was a bit bland also.  Overall though, the three very generous tacos and Agua Fresca were enough to fill me up and keep me happy all the way through the hockey game.  After I get done trying all the other food stalls at this market I think I would give Loteria Taco Bar another try.  
                  Loteria Taco Bar is a relatively new tenant at the San Pedro Market serving Californian style Mexican bites. The tacos were decent but a bit pricey for what they are. Had the shrimp one and al pastor one. Both tasted fine but nothing significantly better than what you could find at any other Mexican eateries. For a $3+ each, the taco size is surprisingly small.   The $4 churros order came as basket of half a dozen churro chunks with chocolate dip on the side. Make sure you have friends to share them with if you want to get that. The agua fresca was good.  I love their clever use of technology. You can opt to get a text message alert when your food is ready. You can also check the status of your order to see how many orders are in front your yours.  
                  I finally got a chance to re-evaluate this place today.  But here&#39;s the TL;DR version: +1 star!  Anyways, so today when I had lunch, I wanted to give this place another shot (any place that has 3 stars or less, deserves a second chance in my opinion, so here&#39;s my chance!)  One thing I noticed was that they done away with that god-awful method of ordering your food in increments. Last time I was here, you could only order only 3, 6, or 10 tacos. Not 4, not 1... not even 2. So I&#39;m so damn thankful they took away that horrible mess. That&#39;s already +0.5 star.  But what really sold me this time is that their presentation was a lot better, their plate wasn&#39;t suffocating the food, and their tacos actually tasted so much better this time around.  Gone are those terrible tortillas they used last time, you know, the ones that ripped at every opportunity. Now enter the tortillas that actually taste great, and STAY IN TACT. That&#39;s freaking wonderful. I&#39;m so glad these guys have changed their game to meet the demand because I instantly enjoyed the fact that I didn&#39;t need a fork for every bite.  Their carne asada was on point! I normally hate avocado, but theirs was simply fantastic! And it wasn&#39;t cold, it was a nice and warm temperature that complemented the meal very well.  And lastly, my biggest peeve with this place was their chips. It still sucks, but at least they increased the size of them! And gave you better portions. I do still, however, hate their salsa. It&#39;s just not good.  However, a great improvement from the last time I went here. I&#39;m impressed now. It&#39;s still not part of the JOSE in san JOSE.. but it&#39;s a good modernized version of Mexican food.  4 stars. +1 from my previous encounter.  Oh, but seriously though, 4 tacos for 15 bucks? GTFO.  
                  Went to San Pedro Square Market the other night for the first time and chose Loteria as our first meal there.  My gf and I were both happy with our choice.  We both ordered the two taco &#34;Taco Bar&#34; deal for $7.50 - two tacos and a generous helping of chips and salsa.  Between us, we had the rock cod, shrimp, habanero mango chicken and al pastor tacos, and all were good with (perhaps surprisingly) the chicken being our favorite.  Chips and salsa are pretty standard, I guess...good enough that I kept eating them but not necessarily remarkable.  Food came out in about 10 minutes on what appeared to be compostable plates.  No complaints there as it was pretty busy when we were there, so not a bad wait at all.  Seating is open at the market so if you are with anyone you may wish to have one person grab a table/spot.  A nice choice for tacos at SPSM, will definitely be back.  
                  This was OK.  Living in Austin we have sooo many taco places and majority of them are pretty damn good.  Having said that, my fellow Texan coworker and I opted to eat here when perusing the market.  I had the duck carnitas, the fish and the spicy chicken.  The duck was just OK.  Which was a bummer because I LOVE DUCK.  The fish was what was to be expected of a fish taco.  The spicy chicken was so far from spicy it made me feel a little ripped off.  All things aside, you get a decent amount of food for the price and the atmosphere and people watching was all pretty solid.  
                  I got the steak quesadilla with veggies for $10. The portion was really big and delicious! So much cheese and toppings inside. It also came with guacamole, salsa, and sour cream. So good. I had leftovers to take home to share.  Took about 10 min for the food, but they didn&#39;t text us when it was ready even though they told us they would so we just went to check if it was ready. But its ok. I would still come back for the food.  
                  I absolutely love fish tacos, so I was thrilled when I found out they serve fried rock cod.  My friend had their market quesadilla (a vegetarian option here) and I had 3 fish tacos. It was 3 pieces of fried rock cod on corn tortillas with lemon cabbage, cilantro and chipotle sauce. My order came with fried tortilla chips with a slightly spicy salsa and several pieces of lime.   For the amount of food I ordered it was only $10. I ate all 3 tacos but I was incredibly food. It was so good I couldn&#39;t stop. I&#39;m not really a fan of Mexican food, but these tacos change my mind.  
                  GREAT little lunch-y taco place, and a fantastic part of San Pedro Square Market. The tacos are itty-bitty, but so so good. Reminds me of artisan taco places in neighborhoods like Wicker Park in Chicago, or the Mission.  My favorite was the fried rock cod one, although the vegetable and chipotle shrimp tacos were also outstanding. Not a weak link in the bunch! The chips, like others have said, are nothing special but it&#39;s the tacos you&#39;re coming for anyway, right? Just be aware-- some things on the menu contain ingredients not listed on the menu (like cheese), and some things don&#39;t contain ingredients they say they do (like cheese).  Super cute and fantastic dining experience.  What a cool, fun place! Great for groups especially.  
                  Got the crispy pork and salmon tacos. They were out of duck :( A++ for the fried pickles. The agua fresca is also on point!  
                  I love there are so many variation you can choose from!  The fish tacos are made fresh (at least every time when I visit), very hot and crispy. I also love all the different ingredients they put in tacos, so they all taste very differently, instead of only changing the meat part of the tacos.  Cod, ahi tuna, duck are my favorite!  
                  Mm decent tacos but I wasn&#39;t too impressed. We ordered the duck carnitas taco and the seared ahi tuna taco. The duck carnitas taco was served with a spicy red mole sauce and pickled red onions. Mm it wasn&#39;t bad, but nothing really wow-ed me about this one. The seared ahi tuna taco came served with seaweed salad, avocado, sriracha, and a sweet soy glaze. I enjoyed this one a lot more; maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m a huge sucker for avocado and let&#39;s face it, siracha makes everything good :P  The tacos came served with a plate of colorful and crunchy tortilla chips. I wouldn&#39;t mind coming back and trying some more of their taco offerings as the ingredients they use seem fresh and their menu seems to offer many creative options.  
                  Got the 2 taco deal for $8ish - Salmon and shrimp. Served with red chips and salsa, the quantity wasn&#39;t much, but it was good otherwise.  
                  I love San Pedro Square Market and so far it has only produced 5 star ratings for me. This is the first place that I will give 3 stars. The tacos are good, I tried three different types, but they are not awesome. Compared to all the other 5 star options in the market, this place gets 3 stars...    I had three types of tacos;    Fried Cod, this was my favorite of the three with fried cod, red cabbage, and chipotle crema. The fish was sparse but nice and crunchy on the outside, light on the inside, not greasy.    Carne asada, with tomatillo salsa and guacamole. This was OK, not your typical grilled skirt steak, more of a stewed meat feeling but lots of it.    Al Pastor, with a pineapple salsa. My least favorite but still pretty good. Lots of pork and salsa made this one really messy. The pork was really wet, again a stewed feeling.    In general, this place seemed like a production environment where everything was cooked in advance and then just assembled for you to order, I would expect more for the price (which doesn&#39;t even match the website). On a good note, they had a 10% off check in offer so the price was just about right.    I&#39;ll probably skip this place next time I&#39;m at the market but try them for yourself!  
                  This is my first review since I hit the double gold badge, so it had better be a good one. I give this place 3 stars. Done. Stay tuned for the next review!  No no, just kidding. Here goes.  First, I love San Pedro Square Market. This was my first visit (apart from some late night drinks at Vino Vino), and I just didn&#39;t realize how many options there were for lunch. My buddy and I walked around until we found something each of us liked. I was immediately drawn to Mexican ...  The lady in front of me ordered one quinoa taco. That seemed kind of odd to me since taqueria tacos are usually quite small; I didn&#39;t think that would fill her up unless maybe the tacos are super big. I decided to be roll the dice and get three tacos. Two seared ahi, and one quinoa.   While everything was sufficiently tasty and I finished the whole meal, I did have a few issues. The ahi was not exaclty seared, more like just flash cooked on the flat top and there was no beautiful sashimi colored tuna in the middle. There was also a sweet soy glaze going on in there that was good for the first bite, but it didn&#39;t take too long to get bored with. I was disappointed. The quinoa was okay because the salsa that accompanied it is excellent. Otherwise, quinoa doesn&#39;t really work as a filling. They also include some nice fresh chips and spicy salsa with your meal. So yes, three tacos was the right amount and I have no idea how that lady got full on one taco.  
                  Located in San Pedro Square Market downtown and walking distance to the SAP Center (formerly known as HP Pavilion).   I ordered two tacos for $7.50.  A real bargain bite.  The menu is written on a blackboard to the left of the counter.  I got the fried cod taco and the carnitas taco both on a soft taco. Great toppings on each. They&#39;re served on a compostable tray.  And a few tortilla chips with salsa on the side.  The soft taco shell was somewhat dry around the edges.   If you check in on yelp you can get 10% off your order.  
                  Yay! I&#39;m loving this new addition to San Pedro Square! I looked through some Yelp reviews and went with the Barbacoa and Chicken Chili Verde something something (on the Specials menu). Someone said that the Barbacoa is always out; today, the carnitas was crossed off. I overheard the lady talking to a customer about her order...sounded like the carnitas had ran out just before I got there. i don&#39;t mind going back to try the carnitas later though.  There&#39;s no need to order anything else other than the tacos here -- they&#39;re BOMB dot com!  They put a big pile of meat on these little tortillas and the meat is so tender and juicy! I only needed two to fill up.  1 taco is $3.95, 2 for $7, 3 for $10  
                  I think Loteria is capable of more stars, and I just didn&#39;t order the right things.  The seared ahi taco is SO good--basically poke in a taco.  I wish I would have ordered more of this.  The chipotle shrimp taco was OK--it had more heat than I was expecting.  We got an order of fried pickles as well--why?  Who knows.  These were super disappointing; the sauce they came with didn&#39;t add much, and they just ended up kind of soggy.  You couldn&#39;t taste the pickle, just batter.  Service was extremely fast--they said a 5-7 min wait for my food, and it came out in less than 5 minutes.  I&#39;d be willing to come back and try some of the other items on their menu.  
                  4 stars for the vegetarian options, 3 stars for the service.  Been here twice. 1) Yucca fries, while tasty, were a bit stringy. 2) Market Quesadilla was awesome and one of the best veggie quesadillas I&#39;ve ever had, but took a rather long time for a quesadilla.  I&#39;d almost finished a pint by the time my quesadilla came out.  Water is also very expensive here.  Sort of a bummer you have to wait around near the restaurant for your food when most other restaurants in SPSM have those little pagers.  But, for that quesadilla, I&#39;m tempted to wait.  
                  I get tacos from here every week and it never disappoints! All the workers are really friendly. I like the steak tacos the best, but they have a lot of interesting combos that are fun to try. Definitely check out this place when you get the chance.  
                  Great food, amazing service!!! An absolute must when hitting up San Pedro Market. I read some of the reviews and people don&#39;t understand that these are REAL Mexican tacos. The size is what a traditional toco should be. If you&#39;re looking for jumbo sized tacos go to Taco Bell. This is a high end eatery in a really nice bar/patio setting. Try the cod, just the right amount of spice and deliciousness!   Staff: Young talent that can make a mean taco!! Great job guys!! :)  
                  May 5th was the 3rd game.  May 5th was my birthday.  Not only did I had lunch at Little Cheese Shoppe that day, I ended my evening by going to the Sharks&#39; Fan Rally and by going to the game.  Two days later, that routine repeated itself.  I was at work and was counting down until take off time.  It was game 4 and fans were certain we&#39;d sweep the Canucks.  I rushed home to change into my jersey and to pick my little one up.    Where did we go to first?  San Pedro Square Market, that&#39;s where!    Browsed around and knew I wanted to try this place because my quest is to try every single joint here.  I wanted tacos... for once I wanted to say I am enjoying my &#39;Taco Tuesday&#34;.  I browsed the menu and proceeded to order...   I forgot how much I paid for the tacos but 1 is $3.95.  I got 2 of the Mango Habanero Chicken and the Beef Barbacoa.  I ordered a side of Lime Rice ($2) and the Plain Quesadilla ($6.50).  The bill came up pretty hefty for someone trying to eat light but what the hell.. we were about to sweep, dude!    The texted I received a little over 7 minutes that my order was ready made me giddy.  I didn&#39;t grab a table.  I just stood at the booths hovering over my food whilst chasing the little one down.  Eventually, the nice worker of San Pedro Square grabbed me a high chair and brought me a spoon; she noticed I was feeding the rice to the boy w/ a fork.    The Mango Habanero Chicken is not my favorite.  Yes, the chicken was tender and flavorful but because I don&#39;t care for mango, it made me entire taco tasted weird plus the texture of the mango is new to me.  I don&#39;t eat fruits.  The Beef Babacoa was delicious!  The beef seemed like it was braised in tomato sauce because it was so tender... love the fresh scallions!  The chips that came w/ it tasted a bit stale to me but I loved the salsa that came w/ it.  The Lime Rice was very dry and very bland.  I immediately apologized to my 20 month year old as soon as I tried it.  Blech.  The Plain Quesadilla was really plain... the best part was the fresh guacamole (that isn&#39;t fully mashed and needed a touch of salt), the sour cream, and the salsa.    I appreciated the &#34;Thank you&#34; text 2 days after my meal.  That was kind of cool.  There goes another bookmark knocked off.  I need Blush and On a Roll.  
                  Love this place for the Yucca fries, tasty, but a bit skimpy on the garlic.  I am still waiting for them to NOT be out of their plaintains (0-2) at this point.   The first time I went here looking for the yucca fries &amp; plaintains, they were out of BOTH. I decided to get a steak quesadilla, which was alright but nothing special.  
                  Food was good and there was a good selection.  The thing that killed me here was the wait.  25 minutes for 5 tacos and a side.  Took about 20 minutes to order in a line of 6.  
                  I am only going to give this place a 3 because of the grease.  The meat was extremely flavorful but oil dripping from my chin was not enjoyable. 8 tacos and 1 quesadilla cost $46.00, be prepared!!!  
                  After trying to steer clear of this place because of the prices, I decided to try, like, almost half their menu one night for dinner.   Tried: Mango Chicken Taco Carne Asada Taco Carnitas Taco Barbacoa Taco Quinoa Peppers Taco Market Quesadilla Honey Lime Watermelon Fresca Churros con chocolate  Out of everything, I liked the mango chicken taco, the market quesadilla, and the watermelon fresca. I was so full from everything else, I took the market quesadilla to go, toasted it for lunch the next day, and it was still delicious. Overall, I would probably get my taco on elsewhere, this place didn&#39;t really do it for me. Wish they had the plantains though, I would have loved to try &#39;em.  
                  i like this place! It is located in san pedro market. I ordered three tacos: seared ahi tuna, carne asada and their popular fried cod. All tacos were relatively good and satisfying. It also came with a side of chips. The size of their tacos are standard, traditional taco sizes. I liked how they text you to let you know when your food is being prepared and when it is done and ready for pick up. This allows anyone to order, grab a drink somewhere and come back right when their food is ready instead of standing there waiting. I will come again Loteria! :]  
                  So my update is that I&#39;m not seeing consistency with these guys. I&#39;ve come back a few times since the initial rave review and ordered the same thing and it&#39;s &#34;meh&#34;. I don&#39;t know about quality control but whatever they are doing is not as great as my initial visit.  I&#39;ve come to eat with enthusiasm and walk away with kind of luke-warm, not great tacos that I would say kind of are not worth the money.  Twice, this has happened and I am wary for a third time. We will see.  
                  Beef barbacoa!  This place was fantastic. food trucks line the inside of this brand new modern food court. While you wait sit at the bar next to the taco counter and have a beer until they text you when your order is up.  Pro tip: Have three tacos, one of each of your favorite styles.  
                  A solid taco meal.  Wide selection of unusual tacos.  shrimp with haver I sauce was the best I had.  Grab a beer from next door.  
                  Yum yum yum! Plantains .... Get them! Pork carnitas tacos were awesome. Salsa has a great kick, and chips are homemade and very good. Will definitely be back to test drive more of the dishes.  
                  San Pedro square is one of the best spots to hit up in downtown SJ.  The atmosphere is super fun and there&#39;s a ton of places to eat and drink at inside.   I&#39;ve been to Loteria before and I&#39;ve left satisfied every time!  In my most recent visit, I had the chipotle shrimp and the rock cod fish tacos. These were excellent and they come in a modernized and cleaner version of your average taco.  Both tacos tasted fresh and were filled with good portions of the shrimp and fish. I also really liked that they drizzle their own kind of orange sauce and top it with a red cabbage mix.  I could seriously eat this everyday.  Granted, the tortilla chips are stale and the prices might be a little intimidating, but the tacos are definitely worth the try!  
                  I love the tacos here. Fish taco is extremely spicy. The steak taco has been the best so far. Barbacoa is also amazing! kinda expensive, but really the best tacos I&#39;ve had in San Jose.  
                  Whenever I&#39;m in San Pedro Square Market the choices of food vendors are numerous but if your in the mood for Mexican food than go here.  Venue: Small shop but within a large seating area, the shop itself is dedicated to only cooking so iced beverages are limited.  Entrees: I ordered the Al Pastor taco and I must say it was DELICIOUS! These tacos are street style so they only come with doubled up small corn tortillas which can easily be split and make two tacos. Al Pastor tends to be oily and in this case it still was. In a previous trip I did also order the Yucca fries and in all honesty I was waiting to be blown away but only only got a fizzle (I would pass on these).  Ambience: the location is within a market so the hustle and bustle is definitely apparent but there is also an outdoor seating area to enjoy some peace and quiet.  Service: I felt the cashier lady was new since she couldn&#39;t explain the tacos I was curious in  -1 Star for the price, you pay $4 for only one taco, not what I would pay if I&#39;m terribly hungry -1 Star for service, Unfortunately the cashier wasn&#39;t knowledgable enough on the tacos for curious me which is why I went with something I already knew  This place is nice if you want to try something new but for the $$$ I would invest in something else more hearty for your money  
                  3 tacos for $10??? Kinda pricey, but hey it&#39;s in downtown and I know rent ain&#39;t cheap! I don&#39;t mind paying that much for tacos...as long as they&#39;re good!  I wanted something with mango like their chicken taco, but the sample was spicy.  Hubby: &#34;We don&#39;t want anything spicy.&#34; Me: &#34;Yeah, I&#39;m sensitive to spicy foods.&#34; Staff: &#34;It&#39;s not really spicy, would you like to try it?&#34; Hubby: &#34;Yeah! We&#39;d like that.&#34; Me: &#34;Yeah! Sure! Thanks!&#34;  A minute later after we sampled the chicken taco... Me: &#34;It is too spicy for me.&#34; Hubby: &#34;Can you make it not spicy?&#34; Staff: &#34;Sure, we can do that for you.&#34;  We ordered a few tacos to go and when I got into the car the first thing I bit into was the chicken taco and it was like fire in my mouth. It was just like the sample. Some people might roll their eyes at me (especially those who love spicy foods), cuz to them it might not be spicy at all. But to me it was so spicy that I couldn&#39;t tell if the chicken itself was delicious or gross. It was like I just swallowed meat soaked in Sriracha. Blechhh.  I wish he just said no, we can&#39;t make it mild and we would have been fine with that and ordered something else.  The carnitas taco was OK, I liked eating it with the colorful chips! My judgement might have been clouded by the spicy chicken still in my mouth so I would love to try the carnitas again. The fish taco was the best out of all three. I&#39;m surprised I could taste the cod goodness with all the fire in my mouth. I love how the cod was tasty, crunchy, and perfectly cooked! I get why it&#39;s &#34;bangin&#39; right now,&#34; as the staff described it.  I will definitely be back when I&#39;m craving tacos. It&#39;s just hard to go there when there are such excellent restaurants competing like Little Chef, Pizza Bocca Lupo, Blush and Vino Vino all in the same market.  
                  Amazing tacos. Smokey salsa.   Carnitas: Best carnitas taco I&#39;ve ever had. It&#39;s authentic. The meat is moist and wet and saucy. There&#39;s so much of it.   Barbacoa: Chipotle has nothing on these. The taco was awesome. The meat was slow cooked and flavorful and the best ive ever had. W-o-w.   Fish: The batter was light like tempura and the fish was really delicate. This was my second favorite.  Shrimp: Ok.  I was kind of full by the time I ate this one so it was hard to tell.  But I&#39;d say it was my least favorite out of the four I tried.  The best tacos on the planet.
